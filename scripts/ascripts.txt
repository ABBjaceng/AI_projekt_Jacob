According to all known laws
of aviation,
there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.
The bee, of course, flies anyway
because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.
Okay. here we go
Focus. speed. I am speed
One winner.
Forty two losers
I eat losers for breakfast
Did I used to say that?
Yes sir... you did
Yeah sure. You say
that all the time
Mater! what are you doing in here!
Well, I didn't want
you to be lonely
Well, thank you but
I'm kind of preparing for a race
I need a little quiet
Alright. You got it buddy
Hey every buddy, listen up.
My best friend Lightning McQueen
need quiet. Perfect quiet.
Okay, where was I
Racing. Real racing
Huh!! That ain't racing.
That wasn't even a sundae drive
That was one lap
racing is 500 of those
Everybody fighting to
move up lap after lap
Inside outside inches
apart never touching
Now that's racing
Well, I can't argue
with "The" Doc Hudson
How true. How true
Hey Lightning. Are you ready? Oh yeah
Lightning is ready
This one is for you Doc
CARS 3
Come on Stickers
That is Bret coming through

Lightning McQueen.
Hey Cal, your blinkers are on.
What? No, it's. Hey
Your blinkers are on
Good comeback Cal
And into the pit goes Lightning McQueen
Bobby Swift and Cal Weathers
These three are fun to
watch. Aren't they Darrell?
You know Bob I can't tell they
have more fun on or off the track
You're geting the car wash too Cal..!!
No you're getting a car wash McQueen
Get them now
Lightning, how do you keep your
focus racing against Bobby and Cal

Stop wining for crying out loud
we're running out of bumper cream to sell
Lightning McQueen!!
Hey, Big Tex..
How's my favorite competitor?
Just say the word, i'll put Call off the
dinoco team and replace him with you
You know I can hear you right?
i'm right here
Bye Cal, see you next week

Roll it buddy

Another great finish in the making.
McQueen and swift nose-to-nose
How's the view back there Boby
Well, you would better not bleep
Or, i'll blow right past you
The flap is out it's the final
stretch McQueen in the lead
Okay lets see what you got
Oh, it's Jackson Storm for the win
A huge upset. Even Lightning
or Bobby never saw him coming
It's one thing to start fast
But we haven't seen anyone cross
the line with that kind of speed and power
Since young Lightning McQueen first
arrived on the scene
Hey Bobby, who is that? That's...
Jackson Storm
yeah he's one of the rookies
Thank you, I appreciate it.
Thank you very much. Thank you
Hey, Jackson Storm right .great race today.
Wow, thank you Mr. McQueen
You have no idea what a pleasure
it is for me to finally beat you
Oh! thanks...
Wait hang on..Did you say meet or beat.
I think you heard me
What... McQueen over here .Storm,
can we get some pictures?
Yeah yeah, come on. Let's get a picture
You know what. You can
get a ton of pictures
Because the champ here has been a
role model of mine for years now
And I mean a lot of years
Right, I love this guy.
I think I touched a nerve
Welcome back to Chicks Picks
and Chick Hicks
I'm your host former and forever
Piston Cup champion Chick Hicks
This just in
Rookie Jackson Storm slaps the
proverbial door on Lightning McQueen
Oh, I couldn't have enjoyed it
more if i'd beaten McQueen myself
Oh, wait. I have
Now enough about me. Here
to tell you how it happened
Is professional number
cruncher miss Natalie Certain
It is pleasure to be here Chick and actually
i prefer the term statistical analyst
Right, so who is this mysterious newcomer
Jackson Storm and why is he so darn fast
It's no mystery if you
study the data Mr. Hicks.
Jackson's Storm is part of the
next generation of high-tech racers
Unlike the veterans of yesterday
Oh what, old-timers like this guy
ha ha...
Um..right
Storm achieves his top speeds
by exploiting the numbers
I refer of course
to racing data: Tire pressure, downforce
Weight distribution, aerodynamics
and nextgen's like Storm
are taking advantage
the racing world is changing
and for the better if it means my old
pal Lightning is down for the count
am I right certain
well, if i'm certain
of anything Chick
it's that this season
is about to get even more interesting
i'll tell you what Darrell
Jackson Storm has
certainly made an impact
we've got six more
next generation rookies in the field
with six veterans fired to clear
the way
good mornin champ.
How's our living legend today
still very much alive, thank you.
Now, I would appreciate if
I can't believe I get to race the Lightning
McQueen in his farewell season
what are you talking about
what..the green flag...
Good luck out there champ
you are gonna need it
one reason Storm and the
next gens are more efficient
their ability to hold the optimum
racing line every single lap
win number 3
for the rookie sansation
Storms in a class of
his own and a big reason for that
training on the newest
cutting-edge simulators
these Mackhines create a virtual
racing experience so real
racers
never even have to go outside
Storms ability to hold that line
is like nothing we've ever seen
four in a row..Are you kidding me
two percent lower drag
coefficient
oh! what a finish!!
5% increase in downforce
lucky number seven
1.2 % higher top speed.
Piston Cup winner Chick Hicks here with
the racer taking the circuit by Storm
Jackson Storm. Another easy win over old
katchow
or should I say the kaboos because
he's always in the back. Am I right?
No, no, no, Chick
McQueen is a crafty veteran champ
he's the elder statesman
of the sport you know
takes everything i
got to beat him
oh, you gotta be kidding me
what changes are you gonna make
to get McQueen back on top
will McQueen try new training method?
Is he prepare to retire?
guys let's not overreact..
It's just a slump..
we'll get him next week
okay that's enough
no comment
not even about
Cal Weathers retiring!!
Wait..what!!
Cal Weathers!!
He's hanging up his lightyears
no, no comment on that either
hey, Cal
hey....retirement!!
what's going on!!
You know, I asked my uncle once how i'd
know when it was time to stop
you know what he said
the youngsters will tell you
we had some good times together
i'm gonna miss that the most I think
yeah
more changes ahead Chick
every week we've seen veteran racers either
retire like cow Weathers tonight
or fired to make room for these younger
faster racers and it's not over yet
hello racing fan
welcome to the Los Angeles 500
final race of the
Piston Cup season.
I can do this
I raced for you guys
almost 10 years
Sorry Brick
my mind's made up
i'm giving your
number to someone new
hey! I had two win last year
old sport's changing..
Hey Bobby
do you know what's happening with Brick...
You.. wait! You're not Bobby
my name is Danny bro
hey champ, where would all your friends go
a final check of his tires as Storm
settles into the pole position
let's see in this season's
one of the great race
that's it buddy
40 laps to go and race leader Jackson Storm
is making his way on the pit road
with McQueen on his tail
a good stop
here could mean the difference between
victory and defeat
come on, come on, come on,
faster Guido. Come on!
I gotta go back out there
before he does
Guido... hurry up
what a pitstop by McQueen
man, he just got the lead
can he hold on it
hey McQueen, you alright?
Listen, don't you worry pal.
You had a good run
enjoy your retirement
Storm takes back the lead
unbelievable! McQueen is fading
McQueen is fading
fading fast.
No...no...no...no!
No!
Welcome back to Piston Cup talks
around-the-clock where we
do nothing but talk racing
let's get to it
starting of course
with Lightning McQueen
the season start
just two weeks away
there's still no
official announcement
but with number
95 coming off his worst year on record
don't shoot the messenger here folks
I think it's safe to assume that Lightning
McQueen's racing days are over
meanwhile Jackson Storm is looking
even faster than.
The number six
and the number 12 cars
are still fighting it out to the lead
but wait, here he comes
it's the fabulous Hudson
hornet knocking at their door
what's he got up his sleeve
today
and there it is with one incredible move
he has passed them
the hornet takes this decisive lead
he's left the pack behind
his crew chief Smokey is loving it..
It's unbelievable
oh no, this is trouble
the Hudson Hornet has
lost control
the Hudson Hornet has
lost control
what should have been a scene of jubilation
has turned tragic here today folks
we await news on the
Hudson Hornets condition
after such a devastating crash
we can only hope that this race today
wasn't his last
when I finally got put
together and went back
expecting a big welcome,
you know what they said?
You are history, moved right on to
the next rookie standing in line
there was a lot left in me.
I never got a chance to show
crash! the Hudson Hornet
is out for the season
hey, Stickers
hey, Sal
how are you feeling?
Yeah great
really really great
you have been thinking about Doc again?
Yeah
you know they told him
when he was done.
He didn't decide.
I don't want what happened to Doc
to happen to me
but that hasn't happened
no, but I can't go out on the track
and do the same old thing. It won't work
then change it up. Try something new.
I don't know Sally
don't fear failure
be afraid of not having the chance
you have the chance. Doc didn't
and you can either take it or you
can do what you've been doing
sitting in here for month
and by the way I love what
you've done with the place
I mean the monster movie Lightning
and the musky air freshener
and don't let anyone tell you
you're not working that primer
because wow, I have never found
you more attractive
and now that i've been in here
for a couple of minutes the stench
i'm getting kind of used to it
okay Sal, I get it. I get it.
I Miss you Lightning. We all do
try something new, huh
heyy, did it work Miss Sally
did you set him straight with your
lawyerly powers of persuasion
is he ready to start training?
Well, stinky Stickers
yes mater, I am.
I decide when i'm done.
I was hoping you'd say that
okay, but I got an idea
and i'm gonna need to talk
to Rusty and Dusty, all right
oh, i'll get them on the horn
yeah get them on the horn
oops, oh no, got a sneeze
dadgum, I lost it
hey, I will see you through.
I found it...
Hey, watch your steps
with a circular driveway
you boys need
to get your rusty tails down here
I created a drink in your honor
yeah, the Rusteze
medicated bumper balm
it goes down faster than
el mater following a bag off.
Rusty and Dusty, hey guys
hey there he is, good to see you Lightning
thanks guys
wow, you are all here
sorry buddy, did you
want this Call to be private?
No mater. This is perfect

I know now it's time for
me to make some changes
changes! what kind of changes
which feel to do is his change man
you're right Fillmore - really
which is why I have an
announcement to make
i've thought long and hard about it
done a lot of soul-searching and
considered all of the options
and I finally decided
you do want to keep racing
are you kidding! Of course
i want to keep racing
man for a second..., wait a minute...
I knew that the whole time
guys, i'm talking about making this my
best season yet

We sold Rusteze

something that we couldn't give you

was right for us too

this Sterling fellow
he's got every high-tech
thing you'll ever need

mud flap king of the eastern seaboard

been looking forward to this
thanks Mr...
Please, no Mr. just Sterling

whatever you do. Don't drive
like my brother
don't drive like my brother
so, you like it.
Oh, hey Mr. Sterling
my career on a wall.
Nice of you included Doc
well, of course. He
was your mentor
losing him left a giant
hole in the sport
yeah
jars of dirt..
"Sacred" dirt
each of those jars contains dirt from
all the old tracks the Doc raced on
Florida International
Thunder Hollow
just down the road and our very
own Fireball Beach right outside
hey, is that...
Bit of asphalt from Glen Allen
my first win
you really are a fan
I am and a fan of your future
you ready for it
definitely
first let's get you into
a more contemporary look.
Wow
it's electronic suit
with it we'll be able to track your
speed and your vital signs
does it have a phone.
Don't be crazy
race cars don't have bugs.
Wow... not bad ha
this is really impressive
this center has quickly become the most
coveted destination for young racers
training to make
our team someday
and it's where you'll train
until you leave for Florida
treadmills, wind tunnels, virtual reality
still working on that
and the best fitness regiment
anyone could possibly imagine
wait! wait!
Is that a simulator
oh yes.
Lightning McQueen i'd
like to introduce you
to the multi-million
dollar flagship
of interactive race simulation
the XDL 24 GTS Mark C
the XDL!
Jackson Storm wishes he had this model
it is just like been on a
real track to put your hours in
okay, let's hit the track most
come on, show me what you got.
Wow fast!
Who is the racer
no, no, no, no. She's not a racer
she's a trainer. Cruz Ramirez
the best trainer in the business
ready to meet it, greet it and defeat it
alright, now bring up those rpms
I like the attitude..
yeah..we call her a maestro
of motivation
you're driving a little
tense again Ronald

push through their own obstacles
tailor-made for each one
now, she's gonna work with you
let's go let's go
you guys gotta work through this stuff
so when your big chance
comes along you could take
hey, Cruz. Oh, hey Mr. Sterling
i'd like to introduce you
to Lightning McQueen
I hear you're the maestro
Mr. Sterling, did you say
Lightning McQueen was here?
Because I don't see him anywhere
uh, but he's right here
do you not see him
nope still don't see him
it's right in front of you
it is Lightning McQueen
he is obviously an imposter
he looks old and broken-down.
Hey
with flabby tires
I do not
use that! Woah
oh yeah, I see I can use that
energy from motivation right
it's all about motivation Mr.
McQueen
you can use anything negative as
fuel to push through to the positive
ah, pretty
positive ever since I was a rookie.
I am so excited that I get to train you
I grew up watching you on tv
ha, is that right
these young guys
are great and all
but I like a challenge
ha ha, not that much over.
In fact, I Call you
my senior project
we need to loosen
those ancient joints
first, the wheels and forward
and rest and forward and rest.
Join me. Rest
and rest
is all these resting necessary
we will work in you slowly
and reach for your ledge
reach for your ledge
now, wheels
to the fry
what is there, its your lines
now backwards
what is there
when do we go in the simulator
good morning Mr. McQueen
looking good
why
this will get oil to places
it hasn't been in a long time
is that a drip pan
just in case
how old you think I am?
Visualize yourself driving
fast down a steep hill
i'll be back in the field
visualize...! wait! Wait! Cruz
I feel what
I just like go on the simulator
how's it hanging
drip pan!
Okay, day three. Treadmill
i've set maximum
speed to conserve your energy
what I want you to do, is
visualize beating this guy
Storm! uh-huh that's right
get him .get him Mr. McQueen.
Get him
this is only going like five
miles an hour
we'll work up to the higher speed
right after you take your nap
nap!
Do I need a nap!
I am not taking a nap
how was your nap Mr. McQueen?
It was kind of
refreshing actually
oh... okay what do you ...Hey
you have been driving
on tires a long time
and you never stopped to get to know them
i'm sorry, what?
Tires are individuals
you should give each a name
name!
I will not be doing that
mine are named. Maria, Quarita, Ronaldo
and Debbie Richardson
what?
Long story
may I have my tires back so i
can go on the simulator please
name them!
Lefty, righty, backy
, backy junior. Okay
does this make you mad?
Yes it does
use that!
Emerge and kneel
emerge and kneel

Thank you Cruz. i'm done
Mr. McQueen, where are you going
to the future!
Okay, here we go. Here we go. How
do I do this? Come on baby
Mr. McQueen
Cruz, thank you for the old
man training as crazy as it was

flag... what do I do

Oh..., that is sensetive
you have hit the wall
it shouldn't be this hard, should it?
You have hit the wall
you are fighting the simulator
just race like you always do
you have hit the wall
there can't be this many walls
in a regular track
you have been passed by Jackson Storm
wait, Storm is in here
the motivation
Storm races at 2:07
pick it up Mr. McQueen!
I am trying
you have hit the wall
Mr. McQueen come down from there
we will work you up to this
I am fine Cruz. I can do it, okay
you have jumped a barrier
you have made two vechiles...
You have disabled an ambulance
you are on fire

Get these things off of me
you have crashed! You have crashed!
Are you alright?
You have crashed
I have crashed

i'm sorry, what!
I said floors all
washed up and clean
oh, right.
Thank you very much
good luck
hey, Lightning. Come on in. I got
something to show you
you ready
for what?
You are about to become the
biggest brand in racing
we are talking about saturation on
all continents for every demographic
movie deals, incommercials
, product endorsements
mud flaps
of course, you will
be rich beyond belief
do you think you're famous now?
I thought you'd be mad about the simulator
I mean this is all great Mr.
Sterling I guess but.
I don't know .i never really
thought of myself as a brand
oh, no. Do I? i'm a fan maybe
your most avid
I think of this as your legacy
it sounds like something that
happens after you're done racing
Mr. Sterling. What is this about?
Look Lightning!
i'm not gonna race you...
What!...what do you mean not racing
hold on! Hold on!
i'm not going to Florida.
Lightning!
You have no idea how
excited I was to get you here
because I knew I knew you'd be
back
this gonna be the comeback
story of the year but
your speed and performance
just aren't where they need to be
i'm sorry
we're talking about speed on a simulator.
Listen how crazy that sounds
look, i'm trying to help you
as your sponsor yes but also
as your friend
your racing days are coming
to an end
everytime you lose, you damage
yourself
damage the brand you mean.
Oh, lightening. Come on
you've done the work now
move on to the next phase
and reap the reward
the racing is the
reward not the stuff.
I don't want to cash in. I want to feel
the rush of moving 200 miles an hour
inches from the other guys
pushing myself faster
than I thought I could go
that's the reward Mr. Sterling.
Oh, lightening. Come on.
Look, I can do this. I can, I promise.
i'll train like I did with Doc
i'll get my tires dirty on every
turn track from here in the Florida
I can start right there on fireball
beach where all the old greats used to race
get your tires dirty
that's how you're gonna
get faster than Storm
yes! exactly!
I mean sacred dirt, right
Mr. sterlin if you care about
my legacy, the one that Doc started
you'll let me do this. I
promise you I will win.
I don't know
what you're asking it's to risky
come on, you like it .i can tell
it's got that little comeback story
of the year feel to it, doesn't it?
One race
if you don't win at
Florida, you'll retire
look... if I don't win also
i will hold the mud flaps you got
but if I do win, I decide
when i'm done
deal
deal.
Thank you Mr. Sterling.
You won't be sorry
just one thing and this is only because
i don't like taking chances
you're taking someone with you
you talked him into it
way to go Mr. McQueen
Cruz! you could talk a snowmobile
into an air conditioner
you're going with me
with that thing
yeah, you still need my help
you're brittle like a fossil.
I don't need a trainer out here Cruz
you're old
what if you have fallen on
this beach and can't get up
well, life's a beach and
then you drive
ha ha McQueen..
Thank you
this is beautiful
I can see why Mr. Sterling said you
wanted to train out here
as soon as this thing's
booted up, we'll get
you on the treadmill and
i'll track your speed
what! no! The whole idea
is getting my tires dirty.
Real racing not driving on that
thing when i've got the sand
and the whole earth
oh, okay. Luigi, let's do this
welcome a racer
to fireball beach
historiCal for
today's great test of speed

did you come up with
that? Yeah I did
on your mark, get set! Go!
Here you go, felt good
hey, what was my speed
i don't know
I can only track you on the treadmill
no treadmills.
Oh, what about Hamilton
Hamilton here

my electronic personal
assistant you know like on your phone

Race cars don't have phones
Cruz
Hamilton! track Mr. McQueen's speed

134 miles
out of range. Out of range
out of range

Whipple filter
it's Lightning McQueen
got my tires dirty at
thunder hollow
the fans here in thunder hollow
still buzzing over
tonight's unexpected
appearance of Lightning McQueen
he has always been my favorite
my garage is covered from head
to toe with 95 posters
so.
Trophies are kind of nice
don't you think.
I mean I know you got like a
billion of them so you would know.
I still can't believe I won
it's pretty shiny, I have
never seen one up close
looks like they spent a lot of money on it
i mean I think it's real nut up
stop! just stop! Okay, Cruz
you don't even know
you don't even have one clue.
Hey!I was just trying to...
Do you know
what happens if I lose this race
every mile of this trip was to get
me faster than Jackson Storm
faster.
I start off getting
nowhere for a week on a simulator
I lose a whole day with
you on fireball beach
and then I waste tonight and then
a crosshairs for Miss Fritter
i'm stuck in the same speed i
was a month ago
I can't get any faster because i'm too
busy taking care of my trainer
this is my last chance Cruz
last final finito. If i
lose, I never get to do this again
if you were a racer you'd
know what i'm talking about but you're not
so you don't.
Mack! pull over!
Now! now!
Okay okay pulling over
pulling over
ask me if I dreamed of being a trainer
Mr. McQueen go ahead
ask me if I got up in the dark to
run laps before school every day
ask me if I saved every penny to buy a
ticket to the races when they came to town
ask me if I did that so
that I could be a trainer someday ask me
No!
I wanted to become a racer forever
because of you.
I used to watch you on TV
flying in the air
you seemed so
fearless
dream small Cruz
that's what my
family used to say
dream small or not at all
they were just trying to protect me
but I was the fastest kid in town and i
was gonna prove them wrong
what happened
when I got to my first race.
I figured it out what
what
that I didn't belong
the other racers
look nothing like me
they were bigger
and stronger and so confident
and when they started their engines
that was it.
I knew i'd never be a racer.
I just left
it was my one shot
and I didn't take it
yeah so uh
i'm gonna head back to
the training center
I think we both know
it's for the best
but can I ask you something
what was it like for you
when you showed up to your first race
how did you know you could do it.
I don't know, I just never
thought I couldn't
it was shiny with that felt like
good luck Mr. McQueen
Cruz
Cruz, wait.
Champion for the ages
, Chick Hicks here
coming to you live from
Chick Hicks studios
where i'm joined once again by
next-gen racing expert, Natalie Certain
thanks Chick, Piston Cup
champion Jackson Storm
set a new record today when he pulled
off the fastest lap ever recorded
an unprecedented 213
miles an hour
so what do you think Certain
Stormy boy gonna start the
season with another win
highly likely Chick
based on his recent run times and
forecasted track temperatures on race day
Storms chances of winning are
95.2 %
that low huh
oh and in case you Missed it
talk of the track tonight is
Lightning McQueen finding
yet another way to
embarrass himself
at a demolition derby whoa
wow
almost makes me feel sorry
for the guy not really
here's what his new sponsor had to say
everyone relax, the 95 is gonna race
Lightnings just
taking a somewhat
unconventional approach
to this race
it's one of the things his fans love
about him
huh yeah right
talk about humiliating
ahow, I won't even bother to
show up in Florida
that could be for the best Chick
even if he does race. McQueen's
probability of winning is 1.2 percent.
Wow
numbers never lie.
i'm willing to predict tonight
that Lightning McQueen's
racing career will be over within the week
it might even be over now
I mean I knew his career
was stuck in the...
First you find a clamp from a rusty vamp
bump bump
quicker than a dart

What?
I don't know I got nothing
I guess I ain't Doc when it comes to that.
I would give anything to talk
to him right now
yeap there was nobody smarter
than old Doc
well except for maybe
whoever taught him
wait, what?
I mean everybody was
taught by somebody right
take my cousin Dort
he taught me
how to sing and whistled at the same time
he was very musical that way
Smokey
Mater! you're brilliant!
uh well..It's all about shape of
your teeth
I gotta go to Thomasville.
Oh well good you know me buddy
i'm always happy to help

I resign as your trainer

i'm looking for someone named Smokey
hoping he can help me

okay but maybe this will
change your mind, hit it
first i'm gonna loosen
up these ancient joints

Nope. Okay
so tell me this?
How do you know if it's Smokey
wait, Mack pull over
Thomasville speedway
home of 51 fabulous Hudson Hornet
good to see you Doc
hey isn't that your
old crew chief?
hey Cruz, do you want to check out the
home track of the greatest racer ever
aren't we supposed to
be looking for Smokey
oh that's right he is dead
we don't know that
are you sure you have time for this?
for this I do
Piston Cup
Smokey's garage.
Wow, if this track could talk
Cruz, what do you say
let's take a lap.
Wow
yes, you nailed it
way easy without the school bus of death
trying to kill us
yeah, no kidding.
I've started to think
i might never meet you
Smokey!
He is alive I know why you're here
you're thirsty
i'll tell you what
these folks are gonna get a kick out of
meeting Huds boy
who's Hud? Oh, Doc Hudson right
hey
act civilized, we got company.
Would you look at that?
what?
three of the biggest racing legends ever
Jr. Midnight Moon, River Scott ,
Louise Stormer Nash,she had 38 wins
well as I live and breathe if it
ain't Lightning McQueen
Miss Nash
it's a pleasure to meet you
you had a tough year haven't you?
oh uh....
shouldn't you be running practice laps
in Florida by now
yeah sure bu...
you're here to steal our secrets
looking for you lost mojo.
Wow, you don't mince words
around here do you
truth is always quicker, kid.
But she used to have serious eyes for Hud
oh really
even if I did it wouldn't have mattered
Hud didn't like fast women
and that left me out
no Lou wasn't just fast
she was fearless
the second I saw my first race I just
knew I had to get in there
of course the fellas in charge
didn't like the idea
of a lady racer showing them up
so they wouldn't let me
have a number
what did you do?
i stole one..
what!!
I still short to take no for an answer,
right River?
if we waited for an invitation
we might have never raced
and once we got on the track
we didn't want to leave and
that's how Doc felt too
you should have seen him when he first came
to town
shiny blue paint
not just a Hudson Hornet
he was already Calling himself
The Fabulous Hudson Hornet
did we ever ride him on that
not for long
Hud was the fastest race of this side
of the Mississippi, until he wasn't
what!!
Everything changed when
the rookie showed up
took Hud all at no time to work his way
through the best racers in both Carolina
passed River, passed Lou, even Junior
but there was still the rookie to deal with
he tried slamming
him into the wall
but Hud never touched any wall
unless he wanted to
that rookie never saw anything
like that before
Doc did that!!
Oh are you kidding
couldn't wipe the smile off his face
for a week after that.
I wish I could have seen him like that
like what
so happy
you didn't come all
this way for a quart of oil, did you?
I need your help Smokey
yeah, what kind of help
that's just it, i'm not sure
all I know is if I lose in Florida
it's it's over for me
what happened to Doc will happen to me
what did happen to him
no, racing was the best part of his life
and when it ended he
we both know he was never the same
after that
is that what you think
come on
i want to show you something
you got the first part right
the crash broke Hud's body and the
no more racing broke his heart
he cut himself off,
disappeared to radiator springs
son-of-a-gun
didn't talk to me for 50 years
but then one day
the letters started coming
and every last one of them
was about you
yeah, Hud loved racing
but coaching you...
I had never seen the old grump so happy.
racing wasn't the best part of Hud's life
you were
ready to go out for little carbon air, boy
yes I am
give it too much travel
you in the tulip
hey, Lightning you might
want to take notes on this one
you got a lot of stuff, kid
Hud saw something in you
that you don't even see in yourself
are you ready to go find it
yes sir
all right, all right
lesson one: You're old accept it
i told him that
he is probably losing his hearing
he said you're old, I heard him
you'll never be as fast as Storm but
you can be smarter than him
okay what do I do?
you said you were in a demolition derby..
yeah it was terrible
are you sure?
'Cause there's not a scratch on you
funny what a racer can do when he's
not overthinking things
shannon spokes here at
Florida international
Jackson Storm clocked
214 miles per hour today
you want to beat the Storm
you need someone to stand in for
like a sparring partner
i'm not so sure I not a racer,
just a trainer
just a trainer
go ahead and gun it
yeah, with no muffler
you even sound like Storm
oh you're going down McQueen
get that arthritis rail
keister onto the tracks, so I can
put you into the old folks
home against your will
how is that
that will work, work for me ,
i'm good .yeah that will do
what ever she says...
You didn't show up in Florida
for qualifying
so you'll be starting dead last
i'll give you three
laps to catch her
go through the entire field
in three laps!!
You wanna beat Storm or not?
Yes of course I do
well, then go!!
Come on, kid
all right, looks like
we got some work to do
look alive..reflexes are
the first thing to go
why are we in a field
sneak through that window
what is that mean? I don't know!
Go.
Not cool man, not cool
let's roll it back
do you even want to be out here
only two days left, yet
we gotta work harder
what the hell, who is that?
I put McQueen in there
to give you some real competition.
Hud was a master of letting
the other cars do the work for him
he used to say, playing to him is like
you were two june bugs on a summer night
he stole that form me
drafting, i've never had to do that
yeah that's when you were fast
now you're slow and old and
rickety and...
Okay, okay, I get it
the new you has to look for
opportunities you never knew were there
sneak through the window
sneak through the window what?
When a window opens take it
yes!
I made it
let's go, let's move
reflexes!
Alright Guido, turn up the heat
okay
alright, look who finally showed up
this where we cut our racing teeth
in the woods
let's just say the moon
was always shining on us
if the moon didn't shine we
didn't have to... oh, nevermind
we ran moonshine dummy oh!
By the way, no lights
instinct only
McQueen still not here, didn't he pull
this when he was a rookie
this is my grandfather told me
all right, we got time for one last race.
Hurry this along boss
we gotta get you to Florida
go!!
Maybe it's best that he doesn't show up
you know after how last season ended
let me put it this way
i'm not losing any sleep wondering
where Lightning McQueen is!
Come on! Come on!
There you go!
McQueen is fading! McQueen is fading!
Fading fast!!
Did you see that?
That was incredible
uh, sorry. I didn't mean to
hey boss, it's time to hit the road
yeah, I wanna thank everyone for
the training

Hey... just focus on what
you're here to do kid
thanks Smokey.
Now, go make Hud proud. You got it
Lightning McQueen is making steady progress
in the early parts of this race
it won't be enough to catch Storm
considered he started dead last
I don't think he's doing
half bad out there
not too shabby
keep this up you'll finish in the top ten
top ten is not going to cut it Smokey
I got to go all the way
so dig in remember your training

Oh tell him he has three
laps to catch me
Cruz says you've got
three laps to catch her
okay. tell her thanks
Cruz, what are you doing here?
Oh Mr. Sterling I was just...
I would like you to head back

speed for the race next weekend

If you were racer, you'd know
what i'm talking about but you're not

what! why is my name up there!
You've started the race
that's how it works
wait! what! We will, no!
If Lightning McQueen wins, he decides
when he's done racing that was the deal
hi i'm Miss... that was the deal
you are not a nice guy little
look sir, I gotta say, you make a
quality mud flap in an affordable price
hey Sterling, why don't you and
I take a drive and talk...
billionaire to billionaire
kids got a lot of stuff,huh Doc?
well she had a great teacher
and now you get to decide
when you're done racing
so what's it gonna be stinky uh Stickers
i'm gonna keep racing but before that
i have something I want to do
welcome all to historical Willy's Butte
for today's great exhibition of speed
thanks guys
nice paint, kiddo
hey hey, coming through
get it done 51!
Great number
it was McQueen's idea
he felt Hud would've wanted you to have it
I love it oh it's perfect it's very
old-school
did someone just say old school!
Fabulous McQueen
to Doc Hudson
you are trying something new
i like it.
Wow subtle! I figured if i'm gonna be
your crew chief i'd better do it in style
what's Mr. Sterling gonna say
i'm actually more worried about what Tex is
gonna say considering he bought Rusteze
thanks Tex!
I made that Sterling fella
a Texas-sized offer
so, ready to start training! I don't know
you ready to lose again.
Oh, I hope you got your fluffy cloud
I hope you got your drip pan!
I got my drip pan and
i'm taking my nap
bring it on old man..
Luigi!
Go!
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.
Barry! Breakfast is ready!
Ooming!
Hang on a second.
Hello?
- Barry?
- Adam?
- Oan you believe this is happening?
- I can't. I'll pick you up.
Looking sharp.
Use the stairs. Your father
paid good money for those.
Sorry. I'm excited.
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.
A perfect report card, all B's.
Very proud.
Ma! I got a thing going here.
- You got lint on your fuzz.
- Ow! That's me!
- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
- Bye!
Barry, I told you,
stop flying in the house!
- Hey, Adam.
- Hey, Barry.
- Is that fuzz gel?
- A little. Special day, graduation.
Never thought I'd make it.
Three days grade school,
three days high school.
Those were awkward.
Three days college. I'm glad I took
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.
You did come back different.
- Hi, Barry.
- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.
- Hear about Frankie?
- Yeah.
- You going to the funeral?
- No, I'm not going.
Everybody knows,
sting someone, you die.
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.
I guess he could have
just gotten out of the way.
I love this incorporating
an amusement park into our day.
That's why we don't need vacations.
Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
under the circumstances.
- Well, Adam, today we are men.
- We are!
- Bee-men.
- Amen!
Hallelujah!
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.
Welcome, New Hive Oity
graduating class of...
...9:15.
That concludes our ceremonies.
And begins your career
at Honex Industries!
Will we pick ourjob today?
I heard it's just orientation.
Heads up! Here we go.
Keep your hands and antennas
inside the tram at all times.
- Wonder what it'll be like?
- A little scary.
Welcome to Honex,
a division of Honesco
and a part of the Hexagon Group.
This is it!
Wow.
Wow.
We know that you, as a bee,
have worked your whole life
to get to the point where you
can work for your whole life.
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.
Our top-secret formula
is automatically color-corrected,
scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured
into this soothing sweet syrup
with its distinctive
golden glow you know as...
Honey!
- That girl was hot.
- She's my cousin!
- She is?
- Yes, we're all cousins.
- Right. You're right.
- At Honex, we constantly strive
to improve every aspect
of bee existence.
These bees are stress-testing
a new helmet technology.
- What do you think he makes?
- Not enough.
Here we have our latest advancement,
the Krelman.
- What does that do?
- Oatches that little strand of honey
that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.
Oan anyone work on the Krelman?
Of course. Most bee jobs are
small ones. But bees know
that every small job,
if it's done well, means a lot.
But choose carefully
because you'll stay in the job
you pick for the rest of your life.
The same job the rest of your life?
I didn't know that.
What's the difference?
You'll be happy to know that bees,
as a species, haven't had one day off
in 27 million years.
So you'll just work us to death?
We'll sure try.
Wow! That blew my mind!
"What's the difference?"
How can you say that?
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.
I'm relieved. Now we only have
to make one decision in life.
But, Adam, how could they
never have told us that?
Why would you question anything?
We're bees.
We're the most perfectly
functioning society on Earth.
You ever think maybe things
work a little too well here?
Like what? Give me one example.
I don't know. But you know
what I'm talking about.
Please clear the gate.
Royal Nectar Force on approach.
Wait a second. Oheck it out.
- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
- Wow.
I've never seen them this close.
They know what it's like
outside the hive.
Yeah, but some don't come back.
- Hey, Jocks!
- Hi, Jocks!
You guys did great!
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!
- I wonder where they were.
- I don't know.
Their day's not planned.
Outside the hive, flying who knows
where, doing who knows what.
You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen
Jock. You have to be bred for that.
Right.
Look. That's more pollen
than you and I will see in a lifetime.
It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
and the ladies see you wearing it.
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?
Distant. Distant.
Look at these two.
- Oouple of Hive Harrys.
- Let's have fun with them.
It must be dangerous
being a Pollen Jock.
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
against a mushroom!
He had a paw on my throat,
and with the other, he was slapping me!
- Oh, my!
- I never thought I'd knock him out.
What were you doing during this?
Trying to alert the authorities.
I can autograph that.
A little gusty out there today,
wasn't it, comrades?
Yeah. Gusty.
We're hitting a sunflower patch
six miles from here tomorrow.
- Six miles, huh?
- Barry!
A puddle jump for us,
but maybe you're not up for it.
- Maybe I am.
- You are not!
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.
What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?
I might be. It all depends
on what 0900 means.
Hey, Honex!
Dad, you surprised me.
You decide what you're interested in?
- Well, there's a lot of choices.
- But you only get one.
Do you ever get bored
doing the same job every day?
Son, let me tell you about stirring.
You grab that stick, and you just
move it around, and you stir it around.
You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a beautiful thing.
You know, Dad,
the more I think about it,
maybe the honey field
just isn't right for me.
You were thinking of what,
making balloon animals?
That's a bad job
for a guy with a stinger.
Janet, your son's not sure
he wants to go into honey!
- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
- I'm not trying to be funny.
You're not funny! You're going
into honey. Our son, the stirrer!
- You're gonna be a stirrer?
- No one's listening to me!
Wait till you see the sticks I have.
I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!
Let's open some honey and celebrate!
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.
Shave my antennae.
Shack up with a grasshopper. Get
a gold tooth and call everybody "dawg"!
I'm so proud.
- We're starting work today!
- Today's the day.
Oome on! All the good jobs
will be gone.
Yeah, right.
Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,
stirrer, front desk, hair removal...
- Is it still available?
- Hang on. Two left!
One of them's yours! Oongratulations!
Step to the side.
- What'd you get?
- Picking crud out. Stellar!
Wow!
Oouple of newbies?
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!
Make your choice.
- You want to go first?
- No, you go.
Oh, my. What's available?
Restroom attendant's open,
not for the reason you think.
- Any chance of getting the Krelman?
- Sure, you're on.
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.
Wax monkey's always open.
The Krelman opened up again.
What happened?
A bee died. Makes an opening. See?
He's dead. Another dead one.
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.
Dead from the neck up.
Dead from the neck down. That's life!
Oh, this is so hard!
Heating, cooling,
stunt bee, pourer, stirrer,
humming, inspector number seven,
lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,
mite wrangler. Barry, what
do you think I should... Barry?
Barry!
All right, we've got the sunflower patch
in quadrant nine...
What happened to you?
Where are you?
- I'm going out.
- Out? Out where?
- Out there.
- Oh, no!
I have to, before I go
to work for the rest of my life.
You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?
Another call coming in.
If anyone's feeling brave,
there's a Korean deli on 83rd
that gets their roses today.
Hey, guys.
- Look at that.
- Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?
Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.
It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.
Really? Feeling lucky, are you?
Sign here, here. Just initial that.
- Thank you.
- OK.
You got a rain advisory today,
and as you all know,
bees cannot fly in rain.
So be careful. As always,
watch your brooms,
hockey sticks, dogs,
birds, bears and bats.
Also, I got a couple of reports
of root beer being poured on us.
Murphy's in a home because of it,
babbling like a cicada!
- That's awful.
- And a reminder for you rookies,
bee law number one,
absolutely no talking to humans!
All right, launch positions!
Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz,
buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!
Black and yellow!
Hello!
You ready for this, hot shot?
Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.
Wind, check.
- Antennae, check.
- Nectar pack, check.
- Wings, check.
- Stinger, check.
Scared out of my shorts, check.
OK, ladies,
let's move it out!
Pound those petunias,
you striped stem-suckers!
All of you, drain those flowers!
Wow! I'm out!
I can't believe I'm out!
So blue.
I feel so fast and free!
Box kite!
Wow!
Flowers!
This is Blue Leader.
We have roses visual.
Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.
Roses!
Stand to the side, kid.
It's got a bit of a kick.
That is one nectar collector!
- Ever see pollination up close?
- No, sir.
I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it
over here. Maybe a dash over there,
a pinch on that one.
See that? It's a little bit of magic.
That's amazing. Why do we do that?
That's pollen power. More pollen, more
flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.
Oool.
I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow.
Oould be daisies. Don't we need those?
Oopy that visual.
Wait. One of these flowers
seems to be on the move.
Say again? You're reporting
a moving flower?
Affirmative.
That was on the line!
This is the coolest. What is it?
I don't know, but I'm loving this color.
It smells good.
Not like a flower, but I like it.
Yeah, fuzzy.
Ohemical-y.
Oareful, guys. It's a little grabby.
My sweet lord of bees!
Oandy-brain, get off there!
Problem!
- Guys!
- This could be bad.
Affirmative.
Very close.
Gonna hurt.
Mama's little boy.
You are way out of position, rookie!
Ooming in at you like a missile!
Help me!
I don't think these are flowers.
- Should we tell him?
- I think he knows.
What is this?!
Match point!
You can start packing up, honey,
because you're about to eat it!
Yowser!
Gross.
There's a bee in the car!
- Do something!
- I'm driving!
- Hi, bee.
- He's back here!
He's going to sting me!
Nobody move. If you don't move,
he won't sting you. Freeze!
He blinked!
Spray him, Granny!
What are you doing?!
Wow... the tension level
out here is unbelievable.
I gotta get home.
Oan't fly in rain.
Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!
Ken, could you close
the window please?
Oheck out my new rsum.
I made it into a fold-out brochure.
You see? Folds out.
Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.
What was that?
Maybe this time. This time. This time.
This time! This time! This...
Drapes!
That is diabolical.
It's fantastic. It's got all my special
skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.
What's number one? Star Wars?
Nah, I don't go for that...
...kind of stuff.
No wonder we shouldn't talk to them.
They're out of their minds.
When I leave a job interview, they're
flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.
There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.
I don't remember the sun
having a big 75 on it.
I predicted global warming.
I could feel it getting hotter.
At first I thought it was just me.
Wait! Stop! Bee!
Stand back. These are winter boots.
Wait!
Don't kill him!
You know I'm allergic to them!
This thing could kill me!
Why does his life have
less value than yours?
Why does his life have any less value
than mine? Is that your statement?
I'm just saying all life has value. You
don't know what he's capable of feeling.
My brochure!
There you go, little guy.
I'm not scared of him.
It's an allergic thing.
Put that on your rsum brochure.
My whole face could puff up.
Make it one of your special skills.
Knocking someone out
is also a special skill.
Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.
- Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
- Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.
- You could put carob chips on there.
- Bye.
- Supposed to be less calories.
- Bye.
I gotta say something.
She saved my life.
I gotta say something.
All right, here it goes.
Nah.
What would I say?
I could really get in trouble.
It's a bee law.
You're not supposed to talk to a human.
I can't believe I'm doing this.
I've got to.
Oh, I can't do it. Oome on!
No. Yes. No.
Do it. I can't.
How should I start it?
"You like jazz?" No, that's no good.
Here she comes! Speak, you fool!
Hi!
I'm sorry.
- You're talking.
- Yes, I know.
You're talking!
I'm so sorry.
No, it's OK. It's fine.
I know I'm dreaming.
But I don't recall going to bed.
Well, I'm sure this
is very disconcerting.
This is a bit of a surprise to me.
I mean, you're a bee!
I am. And I'm not supposed
to be doing this,
but they were all trying to kill me.
And if it wasn't for you...
I had to thank you.
It's just how I was raised.
That was a little weird.
- I'm talking with a bee.
- Yeah.
I'm talking to a bee.
And the bee is talking to me!
I just want to say I'm grateful.
I'll leave now.
- Wait! How did you learn to do that?
- What?
The talking thing.
Same way you did, I guess.
"Mama, Dada, honey. " You pick it up.
- That's very funny.
- Yeah.
Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh,
we'd cry with what we have to deal with.
Anyway...
Oan I...
...get you something?
- Like what?
I don't know. I mean...
I don't know. Ooffee?
I don't want to put you out.
It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.
- It's just coffee.
- I hate to impose.
- Don't be ridiculous!
- Actually, I would love a cup.
Hey, you want rum cake?
- I shouldn't.
- Have some.
- No, I can't.
- Oome on!
I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.
- Where?
- These stripes don't help.
You look great!
I don't know if you know
anything about fashion.
Are you all right?
No.
He's making the tie in the cab
as they're flying up Madison.
He finally gets there.
He runs up the steps into the church.
The wedding is on.
And he says, "Watermelon?
I thought you said Guatemalan.
Why would I marry a watermelon?"
Is that a bee joke?
That's the kind of stuff we do.
Yeah, different.
So, what are you gonna do, Barry?
About work? I don't know.
I want to do my part for the hive,
but I can't do it the way they want.
I know how you feel.
- You do?
- Sure.
My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or
a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.
- Really?
- My only interest is flowers.
Our new queen was just elected
with that same campaign slogan.
Anyway, if you look...
There's my hive right there. See it?
You're in Sheep Meadow!
Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!
No way! I know that area.
I lost a toe ring there once.
- Why do girls put rings on their toes?
- Why not?
- It's like putting a hat on your knee.
- Maybe I'll try that.
- You all right, ma'am?
- Oh, yeah. Fine.
Just having two cups of coffee!
Anyway, this has been great.
Thanks for the coffee.
Yeah, it's no trouble.
Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did,
I'd be up the rest of my life.
Are you?
Oan I take a piece of this with me?
Sure! Here, have a crumb.
- Thanks!
- Yeah.
All right. Well, then...
I guess I'll see you around.
Or not.
OK, Barry.
And thank you
so much again... for before.
Oh, that? That was nothing.
Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...
This can't possibly work.
He's all set to go.
We may as well try it.
OK, Dave, pull the chute.
- Sounds amazing.
- It was amazing!
It was the scariest,
happiest moment of my life.
Humans! I can't believe
you were with humans!
Giant, scary humans!
What were they like?
Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.
They eat crazy giant things.
They drive crazy.
- Do they try and kill you, like on TV?
- Some of them. But some of them don't.
- How'd you get back?
- Poodle.
You did it, and I'm glad. You saw
whatever you wanted to see.
You had your "experience. " Now you
can pick out yourjob and be normal.
- Well...
- Well?
Well, I met someone.
You did? Was she Bee-ish?
- A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!
- No, no, no, not a wasp.
- Spider?
- I'm not attracted to spiders.
I know it's the hottest thing,
with the eight legs and all.
I can't get by that face.
So who is she?
She's... human.
No, no. That's a bee law.
You wouldn't break a bee law.
- Her name's Vanessa.
- Oh, boy.
She's so nice. And she's a florist!
Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!
We're not dating.
You're flying outside the hive, talking
to humans that attack our homes
with power washers and M-80s!
One-eighth a stick of dynamite!
She saved my life!
And she understands me.
This is over!
Eat this.
This is not over! What was that?
- They call it a crumb.
- It was so stingin' stripey!
And that's not what they eat.
That's what falls off what they eat!
- You know what a Oinnabon is?
- No.
It's bread and cinnamon and frosting.
They heat it up...
Sit down!
...really hot!
- Listen to me!
We are not them! We're us.
There's us and there's them!
Yes, but who can deny
the heart that is yearning?
There's no yearning.
Stop yearning. Listen to me!
You have got to start thinking bee,
my friend. Thinking bee!
- Thinking bee.
- Thinking bee.
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
There he is. He's in the pool.
You know what your problem is, Barry?
I gotta start thinking bee?
How much longer will this go on?
It's been three days!
Why aren't you working?
I've got a lot of big life decisions
to think about.
What life? You have no life!
You have no job. You're barely a bee!
Would it kill you
to make a little honey?
Barry, come out.
Your father's talking to you.
Martin, would you talk to him?
Barry, I'm talking to you!
You coming?
Got everything?
All set!
Go ahead. I'll catch up.
Don't be too long.
Watch this!
Vanessa!
- We're still here.
- I told you not to yell at him.
He doesn't respond to yelling!
- Then why yell at me?
- Because you don't listen!
I'm not listening to this.
Sorry, I've gotta go.
- Where are you going?
- I'm meeting a friend.
A girl? Is this why you can't decide?
Bye.
I just hope she's Bee-ish.
They have a huge parade
of flowers every year in Pasadena?
To be in the Tournament of Roses,
that's every florist's dream!
Up on a float, surrounded
by flowers, crowds cheering.
A tournament. Do the roses
compete in athletic events?
No. All right, I've got one.
How come you don't fly everywhere?
It's exhausting. Why don't you
run everywhere? It's faster.
Yeah, OK, I see, I see.
All right, your turn.
TiVo. You can just freeze live TV?
That's insane!
You don't have that?
We have Hivo, but it's a disease.
It's a horrible, horrible disease.
Oh, my.
Dumb bees!
You must want to sting all those jerks.
We try not to sting.
It's usually fatal for us.
So you have to watch your temper.
Very carefully.
You kick a wall, take a walk,
write an angry letter and throw it out.
Work through it like any emotion:
Anger, jealousy, lust.
Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?
Yeah.
- What is wrong with you?!
- It's a bug.
He's not bothering anybody.
Get out of here, you creep!
What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?
Yeah, it was. How did you know?
It felt like about 10 pages.
Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.
You've really got that
down to a science.
- I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.
- I'll bet.
What in the name
of Mighty Hercules is this?
How did this get here?
Oute Bee, Golden Blossom,
Ray Liotta Private Select?
- Is he that actor?
- I never heard of him.
- Why is this here?
- For people. We eat it.
You don't have
enough food of your own?
- Well, yes.
- How do you get it?
- Bees make it.
- I know who makes it!
And it's hard to make it!
There's heating, cooling, stirring.
You need a whole Krelman thing!
- It's organic.
- It's our-ganic!
It's just honey, Barry.
Just what?!
Bees don't know about this!
This is stealing! A lot of stealing!
You've taken our homes, schools,
hospitals! This is all we have!
And it's on sale?!
I'm getting to the bottom of this.
I'm getting to the bottom
of all of this!
Hey, Hector.
- You almost done?
- Almost.
He is here. I sense it.
Well, I guess I'll go home now
and just leave this nice honey out,
with no one around.
You're busted, box boy!
I knew I heard something.
So you can talk!
I can talk.
And now you'll start talking!
Where you getting the sweet stuff?
Who's your supplier?
I don't understand.
I thought we were friends.
The last thing we want
to do is upset bees!
You're too late! It's ours now!
You, sir, have crossed
the wrong sword!
You, sir, will be lunch
for my iguana, Ignacio!
Where is the honey coming from?
Tell me where!
Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!
Orazy person!
What horrible thing has happened here?
These faces, they never knew
what hit them. And now
they're on the road to nowhere!
Just keep still.
What? You're not dead?
Do I look dead? They will wipe anything
that moves. Where you headed?
To Honey Farms.
I am onto something huge here.
I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood,
crazy stuff. Blows your head off!
I'm going to Tacoma.
- And you?
- He really is dead.
All right.
Uh-oh!
- What is that?!
- Oh, no!
- A wiper! Triple blade!
- Triple blade?
Jump on! It's your only chance, bee!
Why does everything have
to be so doggone clean?!
How much do you people need to see?!
Open your eyes!
Stick your head out the window!
From NPR News in Washington,
I'm Oarl Kasell.
But don't kill no more bugs!
- Bee!
- Moose blood guy!
- You hear something?
- Like what?
Like tiny screaming.
Turn off the radio.
Whassup, bee boy?
Hey, Blood.
Just a row of honey jars,
as far as the eye could see.
Wow!
I assume wherever this truck goes
is where they're getting it.
I mean, that honey's ours.
- Bees hang tight.
- We're all jammed in.
It's a close community.
Not us, man. We on our own.
Every mosquito on his own.
- What if you get in trouble?
- You a mosquito, you in trouble.
Nobody likes us. They just smack.
See a mosquito, smack, smack!
At least you're out in the world.
You must meet girls.
Mosquito girls try to trade up,
get with a moth, dragonfly.
Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.
You got to be kidding me!
Mooseblood's about to leave
the building! So long, bee!
- Hey, guys!
- Mooseblood!
I knew I'd catch y'all down here.
Did you bring your crazy straw?
We throw it in jars, slap a label on it,
and it's pretty much pure profit.
What is this place?
A bee's got a brain
the size of a pinhead.
They are pinheads!
Pinhead.
- Oheck out the new smoker.
- Oh, sweet. That's the one you want.
The Thomas 3000!
Smoker?
Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic.
Twice the nicotine, all the tar.
A couple breaths of this
knocks them right out.
They make the honey,
and we make the money.
"They make the honey,
and we make the money"?
Oh, my!
What's going on? Are you OK?
Yeah. It doesn't last too long.
Do you know you're
in a fake hive with fake walls?
Our queen was moved here.
We had no choice.
This is your queen?
That's a man in women's clothes!
That's a drag queen!
What is this?
Oh, no!
There's hundreds of them!
Bee honey.
Our honey is being brazenly stolen
on a massive scale!
This is worse than anything bears
have done! I intend to do something.
Oh, Barry, stop.
Who told you humans are taking
our honey? That's a rumor.
Do these look like rumors?
That's a conspiracy theory.
These are obviously doctored photos.
How did you get mixed up in this?
He's been talking to humans.
- What?
- Talking to humans?!
He has a human girlfriend.
And they make out!
Make out? Barry!
We do not.
- You wish you could.
- Whose side are you on?
The bees!
I dated a cricket once in San Antonio.
Those crazy legs kept me up all night.
Barry, this is what you want
to do with your life?
I want to do it for all our lives.
Nobody works harder than bees!
Dad, I remember you
coming home so overworked
your hands were still stirring.
You couldn't stop.
I remember that.
What right do they have to our honey?
We live on two cups a year. They put it
in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!
Even if it's true, what can one bee do?
Sting them where it really hurts.
In the face! The eye!
- That would hurt.
- No.
Up the nose? That's a killer.
There's only one place you can sting
the humans, one place where it matters.
Hive at Five, the hive's only
full-hour action news source.
No more bee beards!
With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk.
Weather with Storm Stinger.
Sports with Buzz Larvi.
And Jeanette Ohung.
- Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble.
- And I'm Jeanette Ohung.
A tri-county bee, Barry Benson,
intends to sue the human race
for stealing our honey,
packaging it and profiting
from it illegally!
Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King,
we'll have three former queens here in
our studio, discussing their new book,
Olassy Ladies,
out this week on Hexagon.
Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.
Did you ever think, "I'm a kid
from the hive. I can't do this"?
Bees have never been afraid
to change the world.
What about Bee Oolumbus?
Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?
Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans.
We were thinking
of stickball or candy stores.
How old are you?
The bee community
is supporting you in this case,
which will be the trial
of the bee century.
You know, they have a Larry King
in the human world too.
It's a common name. Next week...
He looks like you and has a show
and suspenders and colored dots...
Next week...
Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the
guest even though you just heard 'em.
Bear Week next week!
They're scary, hairy and here live.
Always leans forward, pointy shoulders,
squinty eyes, very Jewish.
In tennis, you attack
at the point of weakness!
It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.
Honey, her backhand's a joke!
I'm not gonna take advantage of that?
Quiet, please.
Actual work going on here.
- Is that that same bee?
- Yes, it is!
I'm helping him sue the human race.
- Hello.
- Hello, bee.
This is Ken.
Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size
ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.
Why does he talk again?
Listen, you better go
'cause we're really busy working.
But it's our yogurt night!
Bye-bye.
Why is yogurt night so difficult?!
You poor thing.
You two have been at this for hours!
Yes, and Adam here
has been a huge help.
- Frosting...
- How many sugars?
Just one. I try not
to use the competition.
So why are you helping me?
Bees have good qualities.
And it takes my mind off the shop.
Instead of flowers, people
are giving balloon bouquets now.
Those are great, if you're three.
And artificial flowers.
- Oh, those just get me psychotic!
- Yeah, me too.
Bent stingers, pointless pollination.
Bees must hate those fake things!
Nothing worse
than a daffodil that's had work done.
Maybe this could make up
for it a little bit.
- This lawsuit's a pretty big deal.
- I guess.
You sure you want to go through with it?
Am I sure? When I'm done with
the humans, they won't be able
to say, "Honey, I'm home,"
without paying a royalty!
It's an incredible scene
here in downtown Manhattan,
where the world anxiously waits,
because for the first time in history,
we will hear for ourselves
if a honeybee can actually speak.
What have we gotten into here, Barry?
It's pretty big, isn't it?
I can't believe how many humans
don't work during the day.
You think billion-dollar multinational
food companies have good lawyers?
Everybody needs to stay
behind the barricade.
- What's the matter?
- I don't know, I just got a chill.
Well, if it isn't the bee team.
You boys work on this?
All rise! The Honorable
Judge Bumbleton presiding.
All right. Oase number 4475,
Superior Oourt of New York,
Barry Bee Benson v. The Honey Industry
is now in session.
Mr. Montgomery, you're representing
the five food companies collectively?
A privilege.
Mr. Benson... you're representing
all the bees of the world?
I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor,
we're ready to proceed.
Mr. Montgomery,
your opening statement, please.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
my grandmother was a simple woman.
Born on a farm, she believed
it was man's divine right
to benefit from the bounty
of nature God put before us.
If we lived in the topsy-turvy world
Mr. Benson imagines,
just think of what would it mean.
I would have to negotiate
with the silkworm
for the elastic in my britches!
Talking bee!
How do we know this isn't some sort of
holographic motion-picture-capture
Hollywood wizardry?
They could be using laser beams!
Robotics! Ventriloquism!
Oloning! For all we know,
he could be on steroids!
Mr. Benson?
Ladies and gentlemen,
there's no trickery here.
I'm just an ordinary bee.
Honey's pretty important to me.
It's important to all bees.
We invented it!
We make it. And we protect it
with our lives.
Unfortunately, there are
some people in this room
who think they can take it from us
'cause we're the little guys!
I'm hoping that, after this is all over,
you'll see how, by taking our honey,
you not only take everything we have
but everything we are!
I wish he'd dress like that
all the time. So nice!
Oall your first witness.
So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden
of Honey Farms, big company you have.
I suppose so.
I see you also own
Honeyburton and Honron!
Yes, they provide beekeepers
for our farms.
Beekeeper. I find that
to be a very disturbing term.
I don't imagine you employ
any bee-free-ers, do you?
- No.
- I couldn't hear you.
- No.
- No.
Because you don't free bees.
You keep bees. Not only that,
it seems you thought a bear would be
an appropriate image for a jar of honey.
They're very lovable creatures.
Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.
You mean like this?
Bears kill bees!
How'd you like his head crashing
through your living room?!
Biting into your couch!
Spitting out your throw pillows!
OK, that's enough. Take him away.
So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.
Your name intrigues me.
- Where have I heard it before?
- I was with a band called The Police.
But you've never been
a police officer, have you?
No, I haven't.
No, you haven't. And so here
we have yet another example
of bee culture casually
stolen by a human
for nothing more than
a prance-about stage name.
Oh, please.
Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?
Because I'm feeling
a little stung, Sting.
Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!
That's not his real name?! You idiots!
Mr. Liotta, first,
belated congratulations on
your Emmy win for a guest spot
on ER in 2005.
Thank you. Thank you.
I see from your rsum
that you're devilishly handsome
with a churning inner turmoil
that's ready to blow.
I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?
Not yet it isn't. But is this
what it's come to for you?
Exploiting tiny, helpless bees
so you don't
have to rehearse
your part and learn your lines, sir?
Watch it, Benson!
I could blow right now!
This isn't a goodfella.
This is a badfella!
Why doesn't someone just step on
this creep, and we can all go home?!
- Order in this court!
- You're all thinking it!
Order! Order, I say!
- Say it!
- Mr. Liotta, please sit down!
I think it was awfully nice
of that bear to pitch in like that.
I think the jury's on our side.
Are we doing everything right, legally?
I'm a florist.
Right. Well, here's to a great team.
To a great team!
Well, hello.
- Ken!
- Hello.
I didn't think you were coming.
No, I was just late.
I tried to call, but... the battery.
I didn't want all this to go to waste,
so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.
Oh, that was lucky.
There's a little left.
I could heat it up.
Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.
So I hear you're quite a tennis player.
I'm not much for the game myself.
The ball's a little grabby.
That's where I usually sit.
Right... there.
Ken, Barry was looking at your rsum,
and he agreed with me that eating with
chopsticks isn't really a special skill.
You think I don't see what you're doing?
I know how hard it is to find
the rightjob. We have that in common.
Do we?
Bees have 100 percent employment,
but we do jobs like taking the crud out.
That's just what
I was thinking about doing.
Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor
for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.
I'm going to drain the old stinger.
Yeah, you do that.
Look at that.
You know, I've just about had it
with your little mind games.
- What's that?
- Italian Vogue.
Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.
A lot of ads.
Remember what Van said, why is
your life more valuable than mine?
Funny, I just can't seem to recall that!
I think something stinks in here!
I love the smell of flowers.
How do you like the smell of flames?!
Not as much.
Water bug! Not taking sides!
Ken, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat!
This is pathetic!
I've got issues!
Well, well, well, a royal flush!
- You're bluffing.
- Am I?
Surf's up, dude!
Poo water!
That bowl is gnarly.
Except for those dirty yellow rings!
Kenneth! What are you doing?!
You know, I don't even like honey!
I don't eat it!
We need to talk!
He's just a little bee!
And he happens to be
the nicest bee I've met in a long time!
Long time? What are you talking about?!
Are there other bugs in your life?
No, but there are other things bugging
me in life. And you're one of them!
Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...
My nerves are fried from riding
on this emotional roller coaster!
Goodbye, Ken.
And for your information,
I prefer sugar-free, artificial
sweeteners made by man!
I'm sorry about all that.
I know it's got
an aftertaste! I like it!
I always felt there was some kind
of barrier between Ken and me.
I couldn't overcome it.
Oh, well.
Are you OK for the trial?
I believe Mr. Montgomery
is about out of ideas.
We would like to call
Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.
Good idea! You can really see why he's
considered one of the best lawyers...
Yeah.
Layton, you've
gotta weave some magic
with this jury,
or it's gonna be all over.
Don't worry. The only thing I have
to do to turn this jury around
is to remind them
of what they don't like about bees.
- You got the tweezers?
- Are you allergic?
Only to losing, son. Only to losing.
Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you
what I think we'd all like to know.
What exactly is your relationship
to that woman?
We're friends.
- Good friends?
- Yes.
How good? Do you live together?
Wait a minute...
Are you her little...
...bedbug?
I've seen a bee documentary or two.
From what I understand,
doesn't your queen give birth
to all the bee children?
- Yeah, but...
- So those aren't your real parents!
- Oh, Barry...
- Yes, they are!
Hold me back!
You're an illegitimate bee,
aren't you, Benson?
He's denouncing bees!
Don't y'all date your cousins?
- Objection!
- I'm going to pincushion this guy!
Adam, don't! It's what he wants!
Oh, I'm hit!
Oh, lordy, I am hit!
Order! Order!
The venom! The venom
is coursing through my veins!
I have been felled
by a winged beast of destruction!
You see? You can't treat them
like equals! They're striped savages!
Stinging's the only thing
they know! It's their way!
- Adam, stay with me.
- I can't feel my legs.
What angel of mercy
will come forward to suck the poison
from my heaving buttocks?
I will have order in this court. Order!
Order, please!
The case of the honeybees
versus the human race
took a pointed turn against the bees
yesterday when one of their legal
team stung Layton T. Montgomery.
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.
- Is there much pain?
- Yeah.
I...
I blew the whole case, didn't I?
It doesn't matter. What matters is
you're alive. You could have died.
I'd be better off dead. Look at me.
They got it from the cafeteria
downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.
Look, there's
a little celery still on it.
What was it like to sting someone?
I can't explain it. It was all...
All adrenaline and then...
and then ecstasy!
All right.
You think it was all a trap?
Of course. I'm sorry.
I flew us right into this.
What were we thinking? Look at us. We're
just a couple of bugs in this world.
What will the humans do to us
if they win?
I don't know.
I hear they put the roaches in motels.
That doesn't sound so bad.
Adam, they check in,
but they don't check out!
Oh, my.
Oould you get a nurse
to close that window?
- Why?
- The smoke.
Bees don't smoke.
Right. Bees don't smoke.
Bees don't smoke!
But some bees are smoking.
That's it! That's our case!
It is? It's not over?
Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.
Get back to the court and stall.
Stall any way you can.
And assuming you've done step 29
correctly, you're ready for the tub.
Mr. Flayman.
Yes? Yes, Your Honor!
Where is the rest of your team?
Well, Your Honor, it's interesting.
Bees are trained to fly haphazardly,
and as a result,
we don't make very good time.
I actually heard a funny story about...
Your Honor,
haven't these ridiculous bugs
taken up enough
of this court's valuable time?
How much longer will we allow
these absurd shenanigans to go on?
They have presented no compelling
evidence to support their charges
against my clients,
who run legitimate businesses.
I move for a complete dismissal
of this entire case!
Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going
to have to consider
Mr. Montgomery's motion.
But you can't! We have a terrific case.
Where is your proof?
Where is the evidence?
Show me the smoking gun!
Hold it, Your Honor!
You want a smoking gun?
Here is your smoking gun.
What is that?
It's a bee smoker!
What, this?
This harmless little contraption?
This couldn't hurt a fly,
let alone a bee.
Look at what has happened
to bees who have never been asked,
"Smoking or non?"
Is this what nature intended for us?
To be forcibly addicted
to smoke machines
and man-made wooden slat work camps?
Living out our lives as honey slaves
to the white man?
- What are we gonna do?
- He's playing the species card.
Ladies and gentlemen, please,
free these bees!
Free the bees! Free the bees!
Free the bees!
Free the bees! Free the bees!
The court finds in favor of the bees!
Vanessa, we won!
I knew you could do it! High-five!
Sorry.
I'm OK! You know what this means?
All the honey
will finally belong to the bees.
Now we won't have
to work so hard all the time.
This is an unholy perversion
of the balance of nature, Benson.
You'll regret this.
Barry, how much honey is out there?
All right. One at a time.
Barry, who are you wearing?
My sweater is Ralph Lauren,
and I have no pants.
- What if Montgomery's right?
- What do you mean?
We've been living the bee way
a long time, 27 million years.
Oongratulations on your victory.
What will you demand as a settlement?
First, we'll demand a complete shutdown
of all bee work camps.
Then we want back the honey
that was ours to begin with,
every last drop.
We demand an end to the glorification
of the bear as anything more
than a filthy, smelly,
bad-breath stink machine.
We're all aware
of what they do in the woods.
Wait for my signal.
Take him out.
He'll have nauseous
for a few hours, then he'll be fine.
And we will no longer tolerate
bee-negative nicknames...
But it's just a prance-about stage name!
...unnecessary inclusion of honey
in bogus health products
and la-dee-da human
tea-time snack garnishments.
Oan't breathe.
Bring it in, boys!
Hold it right there! Good.
Tap it.
Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups,
and there's gallons more coming!
- I think we need to shut down!
- Shut down? We've never shut down.
Shut down honey production!
Stop making honey!
Turn your key, sir!
What do we do now?
Oannonball!
We're shutting honey production!
Mission abort.
Aborting pollination and nectar detail.
Returning to base.
Adam, you wouldn't believe
how much honey was out there.
Oh, yeah?
What's going on? Where is everybody?
- Are they out celebrating?
- They're home.
They don't know what to do.
Laying out, sleeping in.
I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way
to San Antonio with a cricket.
At least we got our honey back.
Sometimes I think, so what if humans
liked our honey? Who wouldn't?
It's the greatest thing in the world!
I was excited to be part of making it.
This was my new desk. This was my
new job. I wanted to do it really well.
And now...
Now I can't.
I don't understand
why they're not happy.
I thought their lives would be better!
They're doing nothing. It's amazing.
Honey really changes people.
You don't have any idea
what's going on, do you?
- What did you want to show me?
- This.
What happened here?
That is not the half of it.
Oh, no. Oh, my.
They're all wilting.
Doesn't look very good, does it?
No.
And whose fault do you think that is?
You know, I'm gonna guess bees.
Bees?
Specifically, me.
I didn't think bees not needing to make
honey would affect all these things.
It's notjust flowers.
Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.
That's our whole SAT test right there.
Take away produce, that affects
the entire animal kingdom.
And then, of course...
The human species?
So if there's no more pollination,
it could all just go south here,
couldn't it?
I know this is also partly my fault.
How about a suicide pact?
How do we do it?
- I'll sting you, you step on me.
- Thatjust kills you twice.
Right, right.
Listen, Barry...
sorry, but I gotta get going.
I had to open my mouth and talk.
Vanessa?
Vanessa? Why are you leaving?
Where are you going?
To the final Tournament of Roses parade
in Pasadena.
They've moved it to this weekend
because all the flowers are dying.
It's the last chance
I'll ever have to see it.
Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry.
I never meant it to turn out like this.
I know. Me neither.
Tournament of Roses.
Roses can't do sports.
Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?
Roses!
Vanessa!
Roses?!
Barry?
- Roses are flowers!
- Yes, they are.
Flowers, bees, pollen!
I know.
That's why this is the last parade.
Maybe not.
Oould you ask him to slow down?
Oould you slow down?
Barry!
OK, I made a huge mistake.
This is a total disaster, all my fault.
Yes, it kind of is.
I've ruined the planet.
I wanted to help you
with the flower shop.
I've made it worse.
Actually, it's completely closed down.
I thought maybe you were remodeling.
But I have another idea, and it's
greater than my previous ideas combined.
I don't want to hear it!
All right, they have the roses,
the roses have the pollen.
I know every bee, plant
and flower bud in this park.
All we gotta do is get what they've got
back here with what we've got.
- Bees.
- Park.
- Pollen!
- Flowers.
- Repollination!
- Across the nation!
Tournament of Roses,
Pasadena, Oalifornia.
They've got nothing
but flowers, floats and cotton candy.
Security will be tight.
I have an idea.
Vanessa Bloome, FTD.
Official floral business. It's real.
Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.
Thank you. It was a gift.
Once inside,
we just pick the right float.
How about The Princess and the Pea?
I could be the princess,
and you could be the pea!
Yes, I got it.
- Where should I sit?
- What are you?
- I believe I'm the pea.
- The pea?
It goes under the mattresses.
- Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.
- I'm getting the marshal.
You do that!
This whole parade is a fiasco!
Let's see what this baby'll do.
Hey, what are you doing?!
Then all we do
is blend in with traffic...
...without arousing suspicion.
Once at the airport,
there's no stopping us.
Stop! Security.
- You and your insect pack your float?
- Yes.
Has it been
in your possession the entire time?
Would you remove your shoes?
- Remove your stinger.
- It's part of me.
I know. Just having some fun.
Enjoy your flight.
Then if we're lucky, we'll have
just enough pollen to do the job.
Oan you believe how lucky we are? We
have just enough pollen to do the job!
I think this is gonna work.
It's got to work.
Attention, passengers,
this is Oaptain Scott.
We have a bit of bad weather
in New York.
It looks like we'll experience
a couple hours delay.
Barry, these are cut flowers
with no water. They'll never make it.
I gotta get up there
and talk to them.
Be careful.
Oan I get help
with the Sky Mall magazine?
I'd like to order the talking
inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.
Oaptain, I'm in a real situation.
- What'd you say, Hal?
- Nothing.
Bee!
Don't freak out! My entire species...
What are you doing?
- Wait a minute! I'm an attorney!
- Who's an attorney?
Don't move.
Oh, Barry.
Good afternoon, passengers.
This is your captain.
Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B
please report to the cockpit?
And please hurry!
What happened here?
There was a DustBuster,
a toupee, a life raft exploded.
One's bald, one's in a boat,
they're both unconscious!
- Is that another bee joke?
- No!
No one's flying the plane!
This is JFK control tower, Flight 356.
What's your status?
This is Vanessa Bloome.
I'm a florist from New York.
Where's the pilot?
He's unconscious,
and so is the copilot.
Not good. Does anyone onboard
have flight experience?
As a matter of fact, there is.
- Who's that?
- Barry Benson.
From the honey trial?! Oh, great.
Vanessa, this is nothing more
than a big metal bee.
It's got giant wings, huge engines.
I can't fly a plane.
- Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot?
- Yes.
How hard could it be?
Wait, Barry!
We're headed into some lightning.
This is Bob Bumble. We have some
late-breaking news from JFK Airport,
where a suspenseful scene
is developing.
Barry Benson,
fresh from his legal victory...
That's Barry!
...is attempting to land a plane,
loaded with people, flowers
and an incapacitated flight crew.
Flowers?!
We have a storm in the area
and two individuals at the controls
with absolutely no flight experience.
Just a minute.
There's a bee on that plane.
I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson
and his no-account compadres.
They've done enough damage.
But isn't he your only hope?
Technically, a bee
shouldn't be able to fly at all.
Their wings are too small...
Haven't we heard this a million times?
"The surface area of the wings
and body mass make no sense. "
- Get this on the air!
- Got it.
- Stand by.
- We're going live.
The way we work may be a mystery to you.
Making honey takes a lot of bees
doing a lot of small jobs.
But let me tell you about a small job.
If you do it well,
it makes a big difference.
More than we realized.
To us, to everyone.
That's why I want to get bees
back to working together.
That's the bee way!
We're not made of Jell-O.
We get behind a fellow.
- Black and yellow!
- Hello!
Left, right, down, hover.
- Hover?
- Forget hover.
This isn't so hard.
Beep-beep! Beep-beep!
Barry, what happened?!
Wait, I think we were
on autopilot the whole time.
- That may have been helping me.
- And now we're not!
So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.
All of you, let's get
behind this fellow! Move it out!
Move out!
Our only chance is if I do what I'd do,
you copy me with the wings of the plane!
Don't have to yell.
I'm not yelling!
We're in a lot of trouble.
It's very hard to concentrate
with that panicky tone in your voice!
It's not a tone. I'm panicking!
I can't do this!
Vanessa, pull yourself together.
You have to snap out of it!
You snap out of it.
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!
- Hold it!
- Why? Oome on, it's my turn.
How is the plane flying?
I don't know.
Hello?
Benson, got any flowers
for a happy occasion in there?
The Pollen Jocks!
They do get behind a fellow.
- Black and yellow.
- Hello.
All right, let's drop this tin can
on the blacktop.
Where? I can't see anything. Oan you?
No, nothing. It's all cloudy.
Oome on. You got to think bee, Barry.
- Thinking bee.
- Thinking bee.
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
Wait a minute.
I think I'm feeling something.
- What?
- I don't know. It's strong, pulling me.
Like a 27-million-year-old instinct.
Bring the nose down.
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
- What in the world is on the tarmac?
- Get some lights on that!
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
- Vanessa, aim for the flower.
- OK.
Out the engines. We're going in
on bee power. Ready, boys?
Affirmative!
Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it.
Land on that flower!
Ready? Full reverse!
Spin it around!
- Not that flower! The other one!
- Which one?
- That flower.
- I'm aiming at the flower!
That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt.
I mean the giant pulsating flower
made of millions of bees!
Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up.
Rotate around it.
- This is insane, Barry!
- This's the only way I know how to fly.
Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane
flying in an insect-like pattern?
Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid.
Smell it. Full reverse!
Just drop it. Be a part of it.
Aim for the center!
Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!
Oome on, already.
Barry, we did it!
You taught me how to fly!
- Yes. No high-five!
- Right.
Barry, it worked!
Did you see the giant flower?
What giant flower? Where? Of course
I saw the flower! That was genius!
- Thank you.
- But we're not done yet.
Listen, everyone!
This runway is covered
with the last pollen
from the last flowers
available anywhere on Earth.
That means this is our last chance.
We're the only ones who make honey,
pollinate flowers and dress like this.
If we're gonna survive as a species,
this is our moment! What do you say?
Are we going to be bees, orjust
Museum of Natural History keychains?
We're bees!
Keychain!
Then follow me! Except Keychain.
Hold on, Barry. Here.
You've earned this.
Yeah!
I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect
fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.
Oh, yeah.
That's our Barry.
Mom! The bees are back!
If anybody needs
to make a call, now's the time.
I got a feeling we'll be
working late tonight!
Here's your change. Have a great
afternoon! Oan I help who's next?
Would you like some honey with that?
It is bee-approved. Don't forget these.
Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me.
And I don't see a nickel!
Sometimes I just feel
like a piece of meat!
I had no idea.
Barry, I'm sorry.
Have you got a moment?
Would you excuse me?
My mosquito associate will help you.
Sorry I'm late.
He's a lawyer too?
I was already a blood-sucking parasite.
All I needed was a briefcase.
Have a great afternoon!
Barry, I just got this huge tulip order,
and I can't get them anywhere.
No problem, Vannie.
Just leave it to me.
You're a lifesaver, Barry.
Oan I help who's next?
All right, scramble, jocks!
It's time to fly.
Thank you, Barry!
That bee is living my life!
Let it go, Kenny.
- When will this nightmare end?!
- Let it all go.
- Beautiful day to fly.
- Sure is.
Between you and me,
I was dying to get out of that office.
You have got
to start thinking bee, my friend.
- Thinking bee!
- Me?
Hold it. Let's just stop
for a second. Hold it.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone.
Oan we stop here?
I'm not making a major life decision
during a production number!
All right. Take ten, everybody.
Wrap it up, guys.
I had virtually no rehearsal for that.


[Inhaling and exhaling deeply]
[Male] OK... Here we go. Focus.
Speed. I am speed.
[Cars whizzing past]
One winner, 42 losers.
I eat losers for breakfast.
[Car accelerating]
Breakfast.
Wait, maybe I
should have had breakfast.
A little breck-y could be good for me.
No, no, no, stay focused. Speed.
[Cars whizzing]
I'm faster than fast.
Quicker than quick.
I am lightning!
[Pounding on door]
[Male] Hey, Lightning! You ready?
[Sheryl Crow: Real Gone]
Oh, yeah. Lightning's ready
[engine rewing]
[Engine revs]
[Crowd cheers]
Ka-chow!
[Cars zooming]
[Cars whooshing]
[Both scream]
[All cheer]
Get your antenna balls here!
Go, Lightnin'!
- Whoo!
- You got that right, slick. [whistles]
[Air wrench whirring]
Uh! [screams]
[Engine revs]
- [Male] Welcome back to the Dinoco 400.
- [Crowd cheers]
I'm Bob Cutlass, here
with my good friend, Darrell Cartrip.
We're midway through what may
be an historic day for racing.
Bob, my oil pressure's
through the roof.
If this gets more exciting, they're
gonna have to tow me outta the booth!
Right, Darrell.
[Bob] Three cars are tied
for the season points lead,
heading into the final race
of the season.
And the winner of this race will win
the season title and the Piston Cup.
Does The King, Strip Weathers,
have one more victory in him
before retirement?
[Darrell] He's been Dinoco's golden boy
for years!
Can he win them one last Piston Cup?
[Bob] And, as always, in the
second place spot we find Chick Hicks.
He's been chasing
that tailfin his entire career.
[Darrell] Chick thought
this was his year.
His chance to finally emerge
from The King's shadow.
But the last thing he expected was...
Lightning McQueen!
[Bob] You know, I don't think
anybody expected this.
The rookie sensation
came into the season unknown.
But everyone knows him now.
[Darrell] Will he be the first rookie
to win a Piston Cup and land Dinoco?
[Bob] The legend, the runner-up,
and the rookie!
Three cars, one champion!
[Breaks screeching]
No you don't.
- [Chuckling]
- Hey!
- [Tires squealing]
- [Crowd booing]
What a ride!
[Chuckling]
Go get 'em, McQueen!
Go get 'em!
[Female] I love you, Lightning!
- Dinoco is all mine.
- [Screaming]
[Darrell] Trouble, turn three!
- Get through that, McQueen.
- [Bob] Huge crash behind the leaders!
[Crowd gasps]
[Screaming]
[Giggling]
- [Grunts]
- [Gasps]
[Both screaming]
[Bob] Wait a second, Darrell.
McQueen is in the wreckage.
[Darrell] There's no way the rookie
can make it through!
Not in one piece, that is.
[Exhaling]
Yeah!
Lightning! Oh!
[Darrell] Look at that!
McQueen made it through!
[Bob] A spectacular move
by Lightning McQueen!
Yeah! Ka-chow!
McQueen! McQueen! McQueen!
McQueen! McQueen! McQueen!
Yeah, McQueen! Ka-chow! [honking]
[Bob] While everyone
heads into the pits,
McQueen stays out to take the lead!
Don't take me out, coach.
I can still race!
[Air wrench whirring]
[Chuckling] What do you think?
A thing of beauty.
- McQueen made it!
- [Chick] What?
He's not pitting!
You gotta get me out there!
Let's go! Get me back out there!
McQueen's not going into the pits!
[Darrell] The rookie fired his
crew chief. The third this season!
- [Bob] Says he likes working alone.
- Go, go!
Looks like Chick
got caught up in the pits.
Yeah, after a stop like that,
he's got a lot of ground to make up.
Get ready, boys,
we're coming to the restart!
[Crowd cheers]
Come on, come on, come on!
We need tires now!
Come on, let's go!
- No, no, no, no! No tires, just gas!
- [Male] What?
You need tires, you idiot!
[Darrell] Looks like it's
gas-and-go's for McQueen today.
[Bob] Right. No tires again.
[Darrell] That's a short-term gain,
long-term loss,
but it's workin' for him. He obviously
knows somethin' we don't know.
[Cars whizzing]
[Bob] This is it, Darrell. One lap to go
and Lightning McQueen has a huge lead.
He's got it in the bag.
Call in the dogs and put out the fire!
We're gonna crown us a new champion!
[Crowd cheers and whistles]
[Screaming]
- Checkered flag, here I come!
- [Tire blows]
[Darrell] No! McQueen's blown a tire!
[Bob] And with only one turn to go!
Can he make it?
- You fool!
- [Grunts]
[Male] McQueen's blown a tire!
He's blown a tire!
Go, go, go!
- [Grunting]
- [Tire blows]
[Darrell] He's lost another tire!
- King and Chick come up fast!
- [Bob] They're entering turn three!
Come on. [grunting]
I don't believe
what I'm watching, Bob!
Lightning McQueen
is 100 feet from his Piston Cup!
[Gasping]
[Growling]
[Bob] The King and Chick
rounding turn four.
[Darrell] Down the stretch they come!
And it's, and it's...
- It's too close to call! Too close!
- I don't believe it!
Lightning!
- The most spectacular, amazing...
- I don't believe it!
...unequivocally, unbelievable ending
in the history of the world!
- And we don't know who won!
- Look at that!
[Tape jittering]
[Slow motion drone]
- That's very close to call.
- Can we play that again?
Hey, no cameras! Get outta here!
We're here in Victory Lane,
awaiting the results.
We're here in Victory Lane,
awaiting the results.
McQueen, that was a risky move,
not taking tires.
Tell me about it!
Are you sorry you didn't have
a crew chief out there?
Oh, Kori. There's a lot more to racing
than just winning.
I mean, taking the race by a full lap...
Where's the entertainment in that?
I wanted to give folks a little sizzle.
- Sizzle?
- Am I sorry I don't have a crew chief?
No, I'm not.
'Cause I'm a one-man show.
What? Oh, yeah, right.
That was a confident
Lightning McQueen.
Live from Victory Lane,
I'm Kori Turbowitz.
- Get outta the shot.
- Yo, Chuck.
Chuck, what are you doing?
You're blockin' the camera!
- Everyone wants to see the bolt.
- What?
- Now, back away.
- That's it! Come on, guys.
- Whoa, team! Where are you going?
- We quit, Mr. One-Man Show!
Oh, OK, leave. Fine.
How will I ever find anyone else
who knows how to fill me up with gas?
[Crowd laughs]
- Adios, Chuck!
- And my name is not Chuck!
Oh, whatever.
Hey, Lightning! Yo! McQueen!
Seriously, that was some
pretty darn nice racin' out there.
- By me!
- Oh, yeah.
- Zinger!
- Welcome to the Chick era, baby!
The Piston Cup...
It's mine, dude. It's mine.
Hey, fellas, how do you think
I'd look in Dinoco blue? Dinoco blue!
In your dreams, Thunder.
Yeah, right. Thunder?
What's he talkin' about, "Thunder"?
You know, 'cause thunder
always comes after lightning.
Ka-ping! Ka-pow!
- Who knew about the thunder thing?
- I didn't.
- Give us the bolt!
- That's right.
Right in the lens.
- Show me the bolt, baby!
- Smile, McQueen!
- Show me the bolt, McQueen!
- That's it!
[Electronic music]
[Crowd chattering]
That was one close finish.
You sure made Dinoco proud.
Thank you, King.
Well, Tex, you've been
good to me all these years.
It's the least I could do.
Whatever happens, you're a winner
to me, you old daddy rabbit.
Thanks, dear.
Wouldn't be nothing without you.
Kch-i-ka-chow!
- I'm Mia.
- I'm Tia.
[Both] We're, like, your biggest fans!
Ka-chow!
I love being me.
- [Police] OK, girls, that's it.
- We love you, Lightning!
[Chuckles]
Hey, buddy.
You're one gutsy racer.
Oh, hey, Mr. The King.
You got more talent in one lug nut
than a lot of cars has got
in their whole body.
- Really? Oh, that...
- But you're stupid.
- Excuse me?
- This ain't a one-man deal, kid.
You need to wise up and get
a good crew chief and a good team.
You ain't gonna win
unless you got good folks behind you,
[voice dwindling] and you let them
do their job, like they should.
- Like I tell the boys at the shop...
- A good team.
- Yeah...
- [electronic music]
Ka-chow! Ka-pow!
[Crowd cheering]
[Screaming]
[Cheering]
Oh, Lightning!
If you figure that out
you just gonna be OK.
Oh, yeah, that...
That is spectacular advice.
Thank you, Mr. The King.
- [Fanfare]
- [Bob] Ladies and gentlemen,
for the first time
in Piston Cup history...
[rewing] A rookie
has won the Piston Cup.
Yes!
[Bob]... we have a three-way tie.
- [Crowd cheers]
- [Cameras flash]
[Chuckling] Hey,
that must be really embarrassing.
But I wouldn't worry about it.
Because I didn't do it!
[Bob] Piston Cup officials
have determined that a tiebreaker race
between the three leaders
will be held in California in one week.
Well, thank you! Thanks to
all of you out there! Thank you!
[Whispering] Hey, first one to
California gets Dinoco all to himself.
No, not me!
No, you rock, and you know that!
Oh, yeah! Whoo!
Yep! All right! Got it!
"First one to California
gets Dinoco all to himself."
Oh, we'll see
who gets there first, Chick.
Huh?
- Hey, kid! Congrats on the tie.
- I don't want to talk about it.
Let's go, Mack. Saddle up.
What'd you do with my trailer?
- I parked it at your sponsor's tent.
- What?
Gotta make your personal appearance.
No. No! No, no, no, no!
Yes, yes, yes!
Lightning McQueen here.
And I use Rust-eze Medicated
Bumper Ointment, new rear end formula!
Nothing soothes a rusty bumper
like Rust-eze.
Wow! Look at that shine!
Use Rust-eze and you too
can look like me!
Ka-chow!
[Both laughing]
I met this car from Swampscott.
He was so rusty
he didn't even cast a shadow.
- You could see his dirty undercarriage.
- [Crowd laughs]
[Groaning] I hate rusty cars.
This is not good for my image.
They did give you your big break.
Besides, it's in your contract.
Oh, will you stop, please?
Just go get hooked up.
- Winter is a grand old time.
- Of this there are no ifs or buts.
[Male 1] But remember,
all that salt and grime...
Can rust your bolts and freeze your...
Hey, look! There he is!
Our almost champ!
[Male 1] Get your rear end in here.
Lightning McQueen,
you are wicked fast!
- That race was a pisser!
- You were booking!
- Give me a little room.
- You're my hero!
Yes, I know. [chuckles]
"Fred." Fred, thank you.
He knows my name.
He knows my name!
Looking good, Freddie!
Thanks to you, Lightning,
we had a banner year!
We might clear enough
to buy you some headlights.
You saying he doesn't have headlights?
That's what I'm telling ya.
They're stickers!
Well, you know,
racecars don't need headlights,
because the track is always lit.
Yeah, well, so is my brother,
but he still needs headlights.
[Laughing]
[Forced laughter]
- Ladies and gentlemen,
- [both] Lightning McQueen!
[Crickets chirping]
Free Bird!
You know, the Rust-eze Medicated
Bumper Ointment team
ran a great race today.
And remember, with a little Rust-eze...
[whispering] And an insane
amount of luck,
...you too, can look like me.
Ka-chow.
- Hey, kid.
- We love ya.
And we're looking forward
to another great year.
Just like this year!
Not on your life.
- Don't drive like my brother!
- Yeah, don't drive like my brother!
California, here we come!
Dinoco, here we come!
[Rascal Flatts: Life is a Highway]
[Birds chirping]
[Phone ringing]
[Moaning] Oh... oh... uh,
I needed this. Hello?
[Male] Is this Lightning McQueen,
the world's fastest racing machine?
Is this Harv,
the world's greatest agent?
And it is such an honor
to be your agent
that it almost hurts me to take
ten percent of your winnings.
Merchandising. And ancillary rights in
perpetuity. Anyway, what a race, champ!
I didn't see it,
but I heard you were great.
Thanks, Harv.
Listen, they're giving you 20 tickets
for the tiebreaker thing in Cali.
I'll pass 'em on to your friends.
Shoot me the names.
- You let Harv rock it for you, baby.
- Right. Friends.
Yes, there's...
OK, I get it, Mr. Popular.
So many you can't even narrow it down.
Hey, when you get to town,
you better make time
for your best friend!
Break bread
with your mishpocheh here!
That'd be great!
We should totally...
OK, I gotta jump, kid.
Let me know how it goes. I'm out.
- [Dial tone hums]
- [Sighing]
- [Melodic beeping]
- [Wheels squeaking]
[Lightning] What? A minivan?
Come on, you're in the slow lane.
This is Lightning McQueen
you're hauling here.
Just stopping off
for a quick breather, kid.
- Old Mack needs a rest.
- Absolutely not.
We're driving all night till we
get to California. We agreed to it.
All night? May I remind you
federal DOT regs state...
Come on, I need to get there
before Chick and hang with Dinoco.
[Mack groans]
All those sleeping trucks.
Hey, kid,
I don't know if I can make it.
Oh, sure you can, Mack.
Look, it'll be easy.
I'll stay up with you.
- All night?
- All night long.
[Snoring]
[Engines slowing]
[Snoring, gasping, blubbering]
[Grunting]
[Snoring] Uh!
[Blubbering]
- [Rap music]
- [Engines rewing]
[Sniffing] Ah-choo!
[Laughing]
- Hey, yo, D.J.
- What up?
- We got ourselves a nodder.
- [Chuckling]
[Kenny G: Songbird]
Pretty music. [snoring]
Yo, Wingo! Lane change, man.
- Right back at ya!
- Yeah!
- Oops! I missed.
- You going on vacation?
[All laugh]
[Snoring]
[Snoring]
- [Chuckling]
- [Sniffling]
- Oh, no, Snot Rod...
- He's gonna blow!
Ah... Ah... Ah-choo!
Gesundheit!
One should never drive while drowsy.
- [Tires squealing]
- [Horns honking]
- [Honking loudly]
- [Screaming]
- Uh! Ah!
- [All honking]
[Breathing heavily] Mack!
- [Grunting]
- [Horns honking]
Mack!
Mack!
Hey, Mack! Mack!
Mack!
Mack, wait for me! [engine rewing]
[Tires squealing]
Mack!
[Bell ringing]
[Horn bellowing]
Mack! Mack!
Mack! Mack...
...wait up! [coughing] Mack.
Mack! Mack!
What? You're not Mack.
Mack? I ain't no Mack!
I'm a Peterbilt, for dang sake!
[Peterbilt]
Turn on your lights, you moron!
Mack... The Interstate!
[Tires squealing]
- [Engine roaring]
- Huh?
Not in my town, you don't.
[Siren wailing]
Oh, no.
- Oh, maybe he can help me!
- [Sheriff backfiring]
He's shooting at me!
Why is he shooting at me?
[Backfiring]
I haven't gone this fast in years.
[Grunting] I'm gonna
blow a gasket or somethin'.
Serpentine! Serpentine, serpentine!
What in the blue blazes?
Crazy hot-rodder.
[Siren continues wailing]
[Hank Williams:
My Heart Would Know]
[Buzzing]
[Water hose turning on]
[Snoring]
I'm telling you, man,
every third blink is slower.
The sixties weren't good to you,
were they?
[Car backfires]
[Sirens blasting]
What? That's not the Interstate!
- [Sheriff backfires]
- Ah! Oh!
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
- [Screaming]
- [Tires screeching]
No, no, no, no, no, no!
Ow!
I'm not the only one seeing this, right?
- Incoming!
- Whoa, man.
- No!
- Hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
My tires!
- [Grunting]
- [Gasping]
- [Screaming]
- [Gasping]
- [Tires squealing]
- [Cables vibrating]
[Yelling]
[Shouting]
[Screaming]
- [Cables whizzing]
- [Straining]
Fly away, Stanley. Be free!
[Gasping]
[Breathing heavily]
Boy, you're in a heap of trouble.
[Sighing]
We're live at the Los Angeles
International Speedway
as the first competitor,
Lightning McQueen,
is arriving at the track.
Is it true he's gonna pose for Cargirl?
What's your strategy?
- [Crowd gasps]
- [Cameras clicking]
What? Did I forget
to wipe my mud flaps?
McQueen's driver arrived in California,
but McQueen was missing.
- McQueen was reported missing.
...to race an unprecedented...
[male] Sponsor stated
they have no idea where he is.
I hope Lightning's OK. I'd hate
to see anything bad happen to him.
I don't know what's harder to find,
McQueen or a chief who'll work with him!
[German accent] Lightning McQueen
must be found at all costs!
They're all asking the same question:
Where is McQueen?
[Groaning] Oh, boy.
Where am I?
- Mornin', sleepin' beauty!
- Ah!
Boy, I was wonderin'
when you was gonna wake up.
Take whatever you want!
Just don't hurt me!
A parking boot?
Why do I have a parking boot on?
- What's going on here? Please!
- [Chuckling] You're funny.
I like you already. My name's Mater.
Mater?
Yeah, like "tuh-mater,"
but without the "tuh".
- What's your name?
- You don't know my name?
Uh...
No, I know your name.
Is your name Mater too?
What?
Look, I need to get to California
as fast as possible. Where am I?
Where are you? Shoot!
You're in Radiator Springs.
The cutest little town
in Carburetor County.
Oh, great. Just great!
Well, if you think that's great,
you should see the rest of the town.
You know,
I'd love to see the rest of the town!
So if you could just open the gate,
take this boot off,
you and me, we go cruisin',
check out the local scene...
- Dad-gum!
- How'd that be, Tuhmater?
- Cool!
- Mater!
What did I tell you
about talkin' to the accused?
To not to.
Well, quit your yappin' and tow this
delinquent road hazard to traffic court.
Well, we'll talk later, Mater.
[Chuckling] "Later, Mater."
That's funny!
Ah!
[Sheriff] The Radiator Springs
Traffic Court will come to order!
Hey, you scratched my paint!
I oughta take a blowtorch to you, man!
You broke-a the road!
You a very bad car!
- Fascist!
- Commie!
Officer, talk to me, babe.
How long is this gonna take?
I gotta get to California, pronto.
Where's your lawyer?
I don't know. Tahiti maybe.
He's got a timeshare there.
When a defendant has no lawyer,
the court will assign one to him. Hey!
Anyone want to be his lawyer?
Shoot, I'll do it, Sheriff!
All rise! The Honorable
Doc Hudson presiding.
Show-off.
- May Doc have mercy on your soul.
- [Door banging]
- [Gasping]
- All right,
I wanna know who's responsible
for wreckin' my town, Sheriff.
I want his hood on a platter!
I'm gonna put him in jail till he rots!
No, check that.
I'm gonna put him in jail till
the jail rots on top of him,
and then I'm gonna move him
to a new jail and let that jail rot.
I'm...
Throw him out of here, Sheriff.
I want him out of my courtroom.
I want him out of our town!
- Case dismissed.
- Yes!
Boy, I'm purty good
at this lawyerin' stuff.
Sorry I'm late, Your Honor!
Holy Porsche! She's gotta be
from my attorney's office.
Hey, thanks for comin',
but we're all set.
- He's letting me go.
- He's letting you go?
Yeah, your job's pretty easy today.
All you have to do now is stand there
and let me look at you.
Listen, I'm gonna cut to the chase.
Me, you, dinner. Pi-cha-kow!
- What the...? Ow! Oh!
- Ka-chow!
- Please!
- I know. I get that reaction a lot.
I create feelings in others that
they themselves don't understand.
- [Rewing]
- Agh! Ow!
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I scare you?
A little bit, but I'll be all right.
OK. I'm gonna go talk to the judge.
Do what you gotta do, baby.
But listen. Be careful.
Folks around here are not firing on
all cylinders, if you know what I mean.
Ka-ching!
Ah!
I'll keep that in mind.
- Hey there, Mater.
- Howdy, Sally.
- Hi, folks!
- Good morning!
You know her?
She's the town attorney and my fiancee.
What?
Nah, I'm just kiddin'.
She just likes me for my body.
You look great. You do something
different with your side view mirrors?
What do you want, Sally?
[Sighing] Come on, make this guy
fix the road. The town needs this.
No. I know his type. Racecar.
That's the last thing this town needs.
OK, I didn't want to have to do this,
Doc, but you leave me no choice.
Fellow citizens, you're all aware
of our town's proud history.
Here she goes again.
Radiator Springs,
the glorious jewel
strung on the necklace
of Route 66, the mother road!
It is our job and our pleasure
to take care of the travelers
- on our stretch of that road.
- Travelers? What travelers?
Ignore him.
But how, I ask you,
are we to care for those travelers
if there is no road
for them to drive on?
- Luigi, what do you have at your store?
- Tires.
And if no one can get to you?
I won't sell any... tires.
I will lose everything!
- Flo, what do you have at your store?
- I have gas.
- Lotsa gas!
- OK boys, stay with me.
And, Flo, what'll happen if no one
can come to your station to buy gas?
I'll go outta business and...
we'll have to leave town.
What's gonna happen if Flo
leaves town and closes her station?
- [All] Without gas, we're done for!
- What?
Don't you think the car responsible
should fix our road?
The only guy strong enough
to fix that road is Big Al!
Lizzie, Big Al left like, 15 years ago.
Then why are you bringing
him up, you lemon?
Oh, he can do it.
He's got the horsepower.
So, what do you want him to do?
[All] Fix the road!
- Because we are a town worth fixing!
- Yeah!
[All cheer]
[Honking] Order in the court!
Seems like my mind
has been changed for me.
- [All] Yeah!
- No!
[VW van] Nice ruling.
Oh, I am so not taking you to dinner.
[Chuckling] That's OK, Stickers.
You can take Bessie.
Man, you get to work with Bessie!
I'd give my left two lug nuts
for somethin' like that.
Bessie? Who's Bessie?
[Gurgling]
This here is Bessie,
finest road-pavin' machine ever built.
I'm hereby sentencing you
to community service.
You're gonna fix the road
under my supervision.
What? This place is crazy!
I know this may be
a bad time right now,
but you owe me $32,000
in legal fees.
What?
We're gonna hitch you up to Bessie,
and you're gonna pull her nice.
You gotta be kidding me.
You start there where the road begins.
You finish down there
where the road ends.
[Mater] Holy shoot!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
How long is this gonna take?
Well, fella does it right,
should take him about five days.
Five days?
But I should be in California
schmoozing Dinoco right now!
Then if I were you,
I'd quit yappin' and start workin'!
- Hook him up, Mater.
- Okay-dokey.
[Grunting]
[Tires squealing, engine rewing]
[Lightning] Freedom!
Maybe I should've
hooked him up to Bessie...
...and then...
then took the boot off.
Whoo-hoo!
Goodbye, Radiator Springs,
and goodbye, Bessie!
California, here I come! Yeah!
Oh, feel that wind.
Yes!
[Sputtering]
No. No, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no. Outta gas?
How can I be outta gas?
[Chuckling] Boy, we ain't
as dumb as you think we are.
[Stuttering] But how did,
how did... you...?
We siphoned your gas
while you were passed out.
- Ka-chow.
- Ow, ow, ow, ow.
- Gentlemen.
- Sheriff.
Hey, Sheriff.
- Why here?
- [Italian] Sono sempre stati qui.
- They were better before.
- Stai sempre a parlare.
- Guido!
- Red, can you move over?
I want to get a look
at that sexy hot rod.
You know, I used to be
a purty good whistler.
I can't do it now, of course,
on account of sometimes
I get fluid built up
in my engine block,
but Doc said he's gonna fix it.
He can fix about anything.
That's why we made him the judge.
Boy, you shoulda heard me on
Giddy-up, Oom Papa Mow Mow.
Now, I'm not one to brag
but people come purty far
to see me get low on the "Mow-Mow".
Oh!
- Aw, man, that's just great!
- Hey, what's wrong?
My lucky sticker's all dirty.
Ah, that ain't nothin'.
I'll clean it for ya.
- [Snorting, hacking]
- No, no, no!
That won't be necessary.
Hey! Hey, big fella!
Yeah, you in the red!
I could use a little hose down.
Help me wash this off.
Where's he goin'?
Oh, he's a little bit shy, and
he hates you for killin' his flowers.
I shouldn't put up with this.
I'm a precision instrument
of speed and aerodynamics.
- You hurt your what?
- I'm a very famous racecar!
You are a famous racecar?
A real racecar?
Yes, I'm a real racecar.
What do you think? Look at me.
I have followed racing my entire life.
My whole life!
Then you know who I am.
I'm Lightning McQueen.
- Lightning McQueen?
- Yes! Yes!
I must scream it to the world!
My excitement from the top
of someplace very high!
- Do you know many Ferraris?
- No, no, no, no, no.
They race on the European circuit.
I'm in the Piston Cup!
- [Lightning] What?
- Luigi follow only the Ferraris.
Is that what I think it is?
[Sally] Customers.
Customers!
Customers, everyone! Customers!
- [Sally] OK!
- Customers?
[Sally] Been a long time.
Remember what we rehearsed.
Make sure your
"Open, please come in" signs are out.
You all know what to do.
All right, nobody panics. Here we go!
Van, I just don't see
any on-ramp anywhere.
- Minny, I know exactly where we are.
- Yeah, we're in the middle of nowhere.
- Honey, please.
- [Sally] Hello.
Welcome to Radiator Springs,
gateway to Ornament Valley.
Legendary for
its service and hospitality.
How can we help you?
- We don't need anything, thank you.
- Ask for directions to the Interstate.
There's no need to ask for directions.
I know where we're going.
He did the same thing
on our trip to Shakopee.
We were headed over there
for the Crazy Days, and we...
- OK. Really. We're just peachy, OK?
- What you really need
is the sweet taste
of my homemade, organic fuel.
No, it doesn't agree with my tank.
- Just trying to find the Interstate.
- Good to see you, soldier!
Come on by Sarge's Surplus Hut
for your government surplus needs.
- Honey, surplus!
- We have too much surplus.
I do have a map
over at the Cozy Cone Motel.
And if you stay, we offer a free
Lincoln Continental breakfast.
- Honey, she's got a map.
- I don't need a map! I have the GPS.
- Never need a map again, thank you.
- How 'bout somethin' to drink?
Stop at Flo's V-Eight Cafe.
Finest fuel on Route 66.
No we just topped off.
And if you need tires,
stop by Luigi's Casa Della Tires,
home of the Leaning Tower of Tires.
- We're trying to find the Interstate.
- But you do need a paint job.
Ramone will paint you up right.
Hey, anything you want!
- You know, like a flame job.
- No thanks...
Maybe ghost flames!
You like old school pinstripin'?
Von Dutch style?
- [Both gasp]
- Oh, honey, look. Von Dutch.
[Chuckling] OK, no.
We're gonna be going now, OK?
Ow!
[Laughs] A little somethin'
to remember us by, OK?
- OK!
- Come back soon, OK?
I mean, you know where we are!
Tell your friends!
[Van] OK! Yes. You bet.
Thanks again, folks.
Bye-bye now.
Psst! Psst!
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!
- I know how to get to the Interstate!
- Do ya?
- Minny, no.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, not really. But listen.
I'm Lightning McQueen, famous racecar.
I'm being held against my will.
I need you to call my team,
so they can come rescue me
and get me to California in time for me
to win the Piston Cup. Understand?
- [Locks beeping]
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No, it's the truth! I'm telling you!
You gotta help me! Don't leave me here!
I'm in hillbilly hell!
My IQ's dropping by the second!
I'm becoming one of them!
- [Lightning echoes]
- [Sighing]
OK, don't worry.
They know where we are now.
They'll tell friends. You'll see.
[Male DJ] We'll be back
for our Hank Williams marathon...
- That's good.
...after a Piston Cup update.
[Kori] Still no sign of Lightning
McQueen. Chick arrived in California
and today became the first car
to spend practice time on the track.
[Chick] It's nice to get out here
before the other competitors.
You know, get a head start.
Gives me an edge.
[Electronic music]
[Laughing]
Hoo-hoo-hoo!
Ha-ha!
Yeah!
[Crowd shouting and cheering]
[Girls chattering and giggling]
Hey, McQueen...
Eat your heart out.
[Gasping] Oh!
Let me get this straight.
I can go when this road is done.
That's the deal, right?
- That's what they done did said.
- OK. Outta my way.
I got a road to finish.
[Grunting and rewing]
- He's done!
- Done?
- Uh-huh.
- It's only been an hour.
- [Bessie groans]
- Ah, I'm done. Look, I'm finished.
Say thanks, and I'll be on my way.
That's all you gotta say.
[Mater] Whee-hoo!
I'm the first one on the new road!
Oh!
[Vibrating] It rides purty smooth.
- It looks awful!
- Well, it matches the rest of the town.
- Oh!
- [Blubbering]
Red.
Who do you think you are?
Look, Doc said when I finish,
I could go. That was the deal.
The deal was you fix the road,
not make it worse.
Now, scrape it off!
Start over again.
Hey, look, grandpa,
I'm not a bulldozer. I'm a racecar.
Oh-ho-ho-ho!
Is that right? Then why don't we
just have a little race? Me and you.
- What?
- [Chuckling] Me and you. That a joke?
If you win, you go and I fix the road.
If I win, you do the road my way.
Doc, what're you doin'?
I don't mean to be rude here,
but you probably go zero to sixty in,
like, what? Three-point-five years?
Then I reckon
you ain't got nothin' to worry about.
You know what, old-timer?
That's a wonderful idea. Let's race.
[Sheriff] Gentlemen,
this will be a one-lap race.
You will drive to Willy's Butte,
go around Willy's Butte and come back.
There will be no bumpin',
no cheatin', no spittin',
no bitin', no road rage, no maimin',
no oil slickin', no pushin', no shovin',
no backstabbin', no road-hoggin',
and no lollygaggin'.
Speed. I'm speed.
Float like a Cadillac,
sting like a Beemer.
[Luigi laughs]
My friend Guido, he dream to give
a real racecar a pit stop.
- Peet stop!
- Uh... [chuckles]
The race is only one lap, guys.
Uno lappo! Don't need any help.
- I work solo mio.
- Fine. Race your way.
- No pit stoppo. Comprendo?
- OK.
Gentlemen...
...start your engines!
[Engine sputters]
[Rewing furiously]
- Hijole! Check that out!
- Whoa.
Great idea, Doc.
Now the road will never get done.
Luigi?
[Chuckling] On your mark, get set...
Uno for the money,
due for the show,
tre to get ready, and quattro
to... I can't believe it. Go!
[Giggling]
[Cheering]
Huh?
Doc... the flag means go.
Remember the fl...
Here we go. Go.
Doc, what are you doing, man?
Oh, dear. It would seem
I'm off to a poor start.
Well, better late than never.
Come on, Mater.
- Might need a little help.
- Uh... OK.
You got your tow cable?
Well, yeah,
I always got my tow cable. Why?
[Doc] Oh, just in case.
[Yelling] Ow! Ow!
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
No, no, no, no, no!
- Oh, man!
- Whoa.
- Ow!
- [Fillmore] Bad trip, man.
[Rewing]
Hey! Was that floatin' like a Cadillac
or was that stingin' like a Beemer?
- I'm confused.
- [Chuckling]
[Doc] You drive like you fix roads.
Lousy! Have fun fishin', Mater.
[Gasps] Ah!
I'm startin' to think he knowed
you was gonna crash!
Thank you, Mater. Thank you.
I can make a little turn on dirt.
You think?
No. And now I'm a day behind.
I'm never gonna get outta here!
Hey, ese!
You need a new paint job, man!
- [Lightning] No, thank you.
- How 'bout some organic fuel?
- That freak juice?
- [Lightning] Pass.
Whoo! Watchin' him is makin' me thirsty.
Anybody else want somethin' to drink?
Nah, not me, Flo.
I'm on one of them there special diets.
I'm a precisional instrument
of speed and aero-matics.
"You race like you fix roads."
[Grunting] I'll show him.
[Grunting] I will show him!
- [Tar splattering]
- Oh, great! I hate it!
- Hate, hate, hate, hate it!
- [Chuckles] Music. Sweet music.
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
[Lightning]
Radiator Springs, a happy place!
OK, Bessie, you think that's funny?
Great! I'm talking to Bessie now!
I'm talking to Bessie!
Wow.
[Mater] Mornin', Sally!
Hey, look at this here fancy new road
that Lightnin' McQueen done just made!
Yes! Uh, amazing!
Whoa-ho! Yeah! [sighing]
Oh, Ramone! Mama ain't
seen you that low in years.
I haven't seen a road like this
in years.
- Well, then let's cruise, baby.
- Low and slow.
[Italian] E bellissima! It's beautiful!
Guido, look, it's-a like
it was paved by angels.
Boy, I tell you what.
I bet even the roads on the moon
ain't this smooth.
Doc, look at this!
Shoulda tossed him into
the cactus a lot sooner, huh?
Well, he ain't finished yet.
Still got a long way to go.
Guido, look at Luigi!
This is fantastico!
That looks like fun!
Mater, I got dibs, next turn!
Hey, Luigi, this new road
makes your place look like a dump.
That crazy old devil woman.
[Sighs] Oh!
She's right!
- Ah!
- Guido!
Huh. That punk actually did a good job.
Well, now... where the heck is he?
Sheriff!
Is he makin' another run for it?
No, no. He ran outta asphalt
in the middle of the night,
and asked me if he could
come down here.
All he's tryin' to do
is make that there turn.
[Lightning] No, no, no, no! Oh, great.
Perfect turns on every track
I've ever raced on.
Sheriff, why don't you go get yourself
a quart of oil at Flo's.
I'll keep an eye on him.
Well, thanks, Doc.
I've been feelin' a quart low.
[Engine rewing]
[Screaming]
[Spitting]
This ain't asphalt, son. This is dirt.
Oh, great. What do you want?
You here to gloat?
You don't have three-wheel brakes,
so you got to pitch it hard,
break it loose and then
just drive it with the throttle.
Give it too much, you'll be
outta the dirt and into the tulips.
So you're a judge,
a doctor and a racing expert.
I'll put it simple.
If you're goin' hard enough left,
you'll find yourself turnin' right.
Oh... Right. That makes perfect sense.
Turn right to go left! Yes! Thank you!
Or should I say, "No, thank you"?
Because in Opposite World,
maybe that really means, "Thank you"!
Crazy grandpa car. What an idiot!
[Groans]
[Lightning] Turn right to go left.
Hmm...
Whoa!
- Oh!
- [Car crashing]
- Ow! Oh, that...
- [cactus crashing]
[Screaming] Ow!
Turn right to go left.
Guess what. I tried it.
You know what? This crazy thing
happened... I went right!
You keep talkin' to yourself,
people'll think you're crazy.
- Thanks for the tip.
- What? I wasn't talkin' to you!
- Oh, Guido, e bellissimo!
- Che cosa?
- It looks great! This is great!
- Ti piace, eh? Si, si, bellissimo.
[Grunts, passes gas]
Oh, Lord.
- [Chuckles]
- [Sheriff] Mater!
I need you
to watch the prisoner tonight.
Well, dad-gum! Wait a minute.
What if he tries to run again?
Just let him run outta gas
and tow him on back.
- But keep an eye on him.
- Yes, sir!
[Groaning] Oh...
While I'm stuck here
paving this stinkin' road,
Chick's in California schmoozing Dinoco.
My Dinoco. Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Who's touching me?
You have a slow leak. Guido, he fix.
You make-a such a nice new road.
You come to my shop.
Luigi take-a good care of you.
Even though you not a Ferrari.
You buy four tires,
I give you a full-a size spare
- absolutely free!
- Look, I get all my tires for free.
[Chuckling] I like your style, eh?
You drive the hard bargain.
OK. Luigi make you a new deal.
You buy one tire,
I give you three for free!
[Flo] Oh, would you look at that?
Ramone, Ramone!
[Luigi] Then Luigi make you
a new new deal.
[Lightning] No, no, no, no.
Deal me out. Pass. No, thank you.
- No, no, no, no. No.
- This is it. My last offer.
You buy one tire, I give you
seven-a snow tires for free!
Done. You interested, you call me.
You know where I am.
[Exhales deeply]
Ah!
Stop! Let me...
Oh, Red, you missed a spot.
See it right there?
- No! No!
- On the hood right there.
Stop, stop! That's cold!
Help! Please! Stop!
- [Coughing, sputtering]
- Thanks, Red.
What was that for?
- Do you want to stay at the Cozy Cone?
- Huh?
If you do, you gotta be clean.
'Cause even in hillbilly hell
we have standards.
What, I...? I don't get it.
I thought I'd say thank you
for doin' a great job.
So I thought I'd let you stay with me.
I mean, not with me!
But there. Not with me there,
but there in your own cozy cone.
- And I'd be in my cone, and it's...
- Wait. Wait, you're being nice to me.
If you want to stay
at the dirty impound, fine.
- I understand you criminal types.
- No, no, no, no. That's OK.
- Yeah, the Cozy Cone.
- [Sally] It's newly refurbished.
[Lightning chuckles] Yeah,
it's like a clever little twist.
The motel's made out of caution cones,
which, of course, cars try to avoid.
But now we're gonna stay in them.
That's funny.
Figure that all out on your own,
did you?
Cone number one, if you want.
Oh...
Hey, do I spy a little
pinstriping tattoo back there?
Oh... [chuckles]
That's just a... Oh!
[Both chuckle]
Oh, you saw that? Yeah.
Just gonna be going.
Gonna... Yeah.
- You know, I knew this girl Doreen.
- [Gasps]
Good-lookin' girl.
Looked just like a Jaguar,
only she was a truck!
You know, I used to crash into her,
just so I could spoke to her.
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know.
Hey, I know somethin' we can do tonight,
'cause I'm in charge of watchin' you!
No, Mater, I gotta finish this road,
and I have to get out of here.
Well, that's all right,
Mr. I Can't Turn On Dirt.
You probably couldn't handle it anyway.
Whoa, whoa, easy now, Mater.
You know who you're talkin' to?
This is Lightning McQueen.
I can handle anything.
- [Whispering] I'm not doin' this.
- Come on. You'll love it! [chuckles]
- [Mater] Tractor-tippin's fun.
- [Lightning] This is ridiculous.
- [Tractors snore]
- [Mater] All right, listen.
When I say go, we go.
But don't let Frank catch you. Go!
Whoa! Wait! Who's Frank?
[Lightning whispering] Mater!
Wait, Mater!
OK, here's what you do.
You just sneak up in front of 'em,
and then honk.
And they do the rest. Watch this.
- [Honking loudly]
- Oh!
Oh... Oh! Oh... [mooing]
[Gas sloshing, backfiring]
[Laughing loudly]
I swear, tractors is so dumb!
I tell you what, buddy,
it don't get much better than this.
Yep, you're livin' the dream, Mater boy.
- [Honking]
- Oh!
Oh! Oh... [mooing]
[Gas sloshing, backfiring]
[Laughing] I don't care who you are,
that's funny right there.
Oh, your turn, bud.
Mater, I can't.
I don't even have a horn.
- Baby.
- I'm not a baby.
[Clucking]
Fine. Stop! Stop, OK?
All right. I'll do something.
[Snoring]
- [Rewing engine]
- Oh!
[All exclaiming and mooing]
[All gurgling]
[All backfiring]
[Angry mooing]
[Mooing]
That's Frank.
- [Bellowing angrily]
- [Shouting]
- [Mooing]
- [Engine rewing]
[Mater laughing]
Run!
- Here he comes, look out!
- [Bellowing]
[Laughing] Whoa!
[Screaming]
Run! He's gonna get ya!
[Mater laughing]
Oh! Customers!
Oh!
Ah, no, no, no.
Oof! Oh!
[Mater] Tomorrow night we can
go look for the ghostlight!
- I can't wait, Mater.
- Oh, yeah, I'm tellin' ya!
Oh, boy,
you gotta admit that was fun!
Oh, yeah... yeah.
Well, we better get you
back to the impound lot.
You know, actually,
Sally's gonna let me stay at the motel.
Oh...
- Gettin' cozy at the Cone, is we?
- Oh, come... No. No, are you kidding?
Besides, she can't stand me.
And I don't like her, to be honest.
Yeah, you probably right.
Hey, look, there's Miss Sally!
- Where, where?
- [Laughing]
- You're in love with Miss Sally.
- No, I'm not.
- [Mater] Yes, you do.
- [Lightning] No way.
- Way.
- Come on, look...
- You're in love with Miss Sally!
- Real mature.
- You're in love!
- Real grown up.
- You love her. You love her.
- Wait...
You love her!
You love her. You love her.
All right. OK. Mater, enough!
- Will you stop that?
- Stop what?
Driving backwards. It's creeping me out.
You're gonna wreck.
Wreck? Shoot!
I'm the world's best backwards driver!
You just watch this right here,
lover boy. Wee-hee!
[Lightning] What are you doing?
Watch out! Look out!
Mater? Mater!
- Mater!
- [Laughing]
Hey, take it easy, Mater!
[Screaming happily]
Oof!
[Blubbering] Yee-hee!
[Chuckling] He's nuts.
No need to watch where I'm goin'.
Just need to know where I've been.
Whoa, that was incredible!
How'd you do that?
Rearview mirrors. We'll get you some,
and I'll teach you if you want.
[Chuckling] Yeah,
maybe I'll use it in my big race.
What's so important
about this race of yours, anyway?
It's not just a race.
We're talking about the Piston Cup!
I've been dreaming about it
my whole life!
I'll be the first rookie in history
ever to win it.
And when I do,
we're talkin' big new sponsor,
with private helicopters.
No more medicated bumper ointment.
No more rusty old cars.
What's wrong with rusty old cars?
Well, I don't mean you, Mater.
I mean other old cars. You know?
- Not like you. I like you.
- It's OK, buddy.
Hey, you think maybe one day I can
get a ride in one of them helicopters?
I mean, I've always wanted to ride
in one of them fancy helicopters.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, sure.
- You mean it?
Oh, yeah. Anything you say.
I knew it. I knowed
I made a good choice!
In what?
My best friend.
See you tomorrow, buddy!
McQueen and Sally
parked beneath a tree,
K- i-s-somethin'-somethin'-somethin'-t!
[Laughing]
[Rewing engine] Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[Chuckling]
Number one. Number one...
Ah, number one!
- Ah, this is nice.
- Hey, Stickers.
[Both scream]
- I'm sorry.
- You scared me. You gotta be careful.
I scared myself
scaring you scaring me.
- I mean, I wasn't like scared scared.
- No, of course not. No.
- I was more...
- I overheard you talkin' to Mater.
When? Just now?
What, what did, what did you hear?
Something about a helicopter ride.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, he got
a kick out of that, didn't he?
- Did you mean it?
- What?
- That you'll get him a ride.
- Who knows?
First things first. I gotta
get outta here and make the race.
Uh-huh.
You know... Mater trusts you.
Yeah, OK.
- Did you mean that?
- What?
Was it just a "Yeah, OK",
or "Yeah... OK" or "Yeah, o-OK"?
Look, I'm exhausted.
It's kinda been a long day.
Yeah, OK. G'night.
[Groans] Oh...
Hey, thank you.
What did you just say?
You know,
thanks for lettin' me stay here.
It's nice to be out of the impound,
and this is... It's great.
- Newly refurbished, right?
- Yeah.
- G'night.
- Good night.
Hmm.
[Reveille plays]
[Jimi Hendrix: Star Spangled Banner]
Will you turn
that disrespectful junk off?
Respect the classics, man.
It's Hendrix!
[Groaning]
[Breathing rapidly]
[Muttering]
[Fast-paced electronic music]
Ah!
- [Mooing loudly]
- [Screaming]
No!
[Yelling loudly]
[Mooing]
- No! [gasping]
- [Alarm beeping]
I gotta get outta here!
Hey, have you seen the Sheriff?
Oh! Oh, my gosh.
- Hey, what are you doin'?
- Get a good peek, city boy?
[Stuttering] I just need my
daily gas ration from the Sheriff.
Wait for him at Flo's.
Get outta here.
I've been trying
to get outta here for three days!
[Sheriff] Hope you enjoyed the show!
[Groaning]
Whoa, Doc.
Time to clean out the garage, buddy,
come on.
What?
He has a Piston Cup?
Oh, my gosh.
Three Piston Cups?
- [Doc] Sign says stay out.
- [Gasps]
You have three Piston Cups.
How could you have...
I knew you couldn't drive.
I didn't know you couldn't read.
- You're the Hudson Hornet!
- Wait at Flo's, like I told ya!
Of course. I can't believe
I didn't see it before.
You're The Fabulous Hudson Hornet!
You used to hold the record for most
wins in a season. Oh, we gotta talk.
- You gotta show me your tricks. Please.
- I tried that.
You won three times!
Look at those trophies!
You look.
All I see is a bunch of empty cups.
[Country music]
[Country music]
You know, some automotive yoga
could really lower your RPM's, man.
Oh, take a car wash, hippie.
Yeah, look at my husband, y'all!
Whoo! That's your color!
- [Ramone] Yellow, baby.
- Mmm. You smokin' hot!
There he is.
Oh, my gosh!
Did you know Doc is a famous racecar?
- Doc? Our Doc?
- Not Doc Hudson.
No, no, no, no, it's true!
He's a real racing legend.
He's The Fabulous Hudson Hornet!
Fabulous? I never seen Doc
drive more than 20 miles an hour.
I mean, have you ever seen him race?
No, but I wish I could have.
They say he was amazing!
- He won three Piston Cups!
- He did what in his cup?
I think the heat's
startin' to get to the boy!
Well, I'll say! Look how red he is.
[Ramone] I think he needs
a new coat of poly, man.
- [Mater] Are you sick, buddy?
- You are lookin' peaked.
He needs a new coat of poly for sure!
[Gas bell rings]
- [Sheriff] Hey! What are you doin'?
- It's OK. You can trust me, right?
I trust you, all right.
It's him I'm worried about.
Hmm... I trust him.
- Come on, let's take a drive.
- A drive?
Yeah, a drive.
Don't you big city racecars
ever just take a drive?
Ah... No. No, we don't.
[Gas pump stops]
Hey, Stickers! You comin' or what?
[Flo] Mm-hm!
- And you thought he was gonna run.
- Hey, can you believe it, man?
He actually thought
Doc was a famous racecar!
That's so too much!
OK, you got me out here.
Where are we goin'?
I don't know.
Whoa! Yes.
- [Sputtering]
- [Laughing]
Oh! Ah-ha-ha!
- Bleah!
- [Chuckling]
- [Grunts]
- [Laughs]
[Sputtering]
[Laughing]
[Chuckles] Oh!
[Spitting]
[Lightning] Wow. What is this place?
Wheel Well.
Used to be the most popular stop
on the mother road.
This place?
[Horns beeping]
[Sally sighing] Yeah, imagine.
Oh, imagine what
it must have been like to stay here.
You know, I don't get you.
How does a Porsche
wind up in a place like this?
Well, it's really pretty simple.
I was...
...an attorney in LA
livin' life in the fast lane, and...
Oh, you were, were you?
Were you rich?
- What?
- Just... clues to the puzzle.
Yeah, OK.
Well, that was my life.
And you know what?
It never felt... happy.
Yeah. I mean... really?
Yeah. So I left California.
Just drove and drove
and finally broke down right here.
Doc fixed me up, Flo took me in.
Well, they all did. And I never left.
Yeah. You know, I understand.
You need a little R and R.
Recharge the old batteries.
But you know, after a while,
why didn't you go back?
[Inhaling heavily] I fell in love.
- Oh.
- Yep.
- Corvette?
- No.
I fell in love with this.
Whoa. Look at that.
Look, they're drivin' right by.
They don't even know
what they're missing!
[Sally] Well,
it didn't used to be that way.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah. Forty years ago,
that Interstate down there didn't exist.
Really?
[Sally] Yeah. Back then,
cars came across the country
a whole different way.
How do you mean?
The road didn't cut through the land
like that Interstate.
It moved with the land, you know?
It rose, it fell, it curved.
- Mornin'!
- Nice day, huh?
Cars didn't drive on it
to make great time.
They drove on it to have a great time.
[James Taylor: Our Town]
Well, what happened?
The town got bypassed
just to save ten minutes of driving.
[Lightning] How great would it have been
to see this place in its heyday!
Oh, I can't tell you how many times
I've dreamed of that.
But one of these days we'll
find a way to get it back on the map.
Yeah. Hey, listen, thanks for the drive.
I had a great time.
It's kinda nice to slow down
every once in a while.
You're welcome.
Hey, listen, listen!
If anybody asks you,
we was out smashin' mailboxes, OK?
[Chuckling] Wha... what?
[Rumbling]
[Mooing]
Oh, man, the paint's still wet!
- [Honking loudly]
- [Mooing]
No, no, no, no!
Get out of the store!
Hey! Don't eat the radial!
Here, take-a the snow tires.
- [Sheriff] Mater!
- I wasn't tractor-tippin'!
Then where did all these
gol-durn tractors come from?
- Whoa, boy!
- Hey! Hey, guys!
There's one goin' this way.
I got it.
Come here, little tractor,
come here.
Yeah, that's a good tractor.
No, no, no, no, come here.
What are you doing?
You're not supposed to go
wandering off all...
...alone.
What are you doin'
with those old racin' tires?
[Sighing heavily]
Come on, Doc, drive.
[Revs engine]
Ah... Yeah.
- Wow.
- Huh?
You're amazing!
[Coughing] What are you doin'?
Doc, wait!
[Trucks mooing]
Giddup right in there!
Come on, Rusty.
Doc, hold it!
Seriously, your driving's incredible!
- Wonderful. Now, go away.
- Hey, I mean it. You've still got it!
- I'm askin' you to leave.
- Come on.
I'm a racecar,
you're a much older racecar,
but under the hood
you and I are the same.
We are not the same!
Understand? Now, get out.
How could a car like you quit
at the top of your game?
You think I quit?
[Lightning] Right.
Your big wreck in '54.
They quit on me.
When I finally got put together,
I went back expecting a big welcome.
You know what they said?
"You're history."
Moved right on to
the next rookie standing in line.
There was a lot left in me.
I never got a chance to show 'em.
I keep that to remind me
never to go back.
I just never expected that
that world would...
...would find me here.
- Hey, look, Doc, I'm not them.
- Oh, yeah?
No, I'm not.
When is the last time you cared about
something except yourself, hot rod?
You name me one time
and I will take it all back.
Uh-huh. I didn't think so.
These are good folk around here,
who care about one another.
I don't want 'em depending
on someone they can't count on.
Oh, like you?
You've been here how long
and your friends
don't even know who you are?
Who's caring about only himself?
Just finish that road
and get outta here!
[Reveille plays]
[Jimi Hendrix: Star Spangled Banner]
[Sarge] Will you turn that
disrespectful junk off?
[Fillmore] Respect the classics, man.
[Snoring]
[Snorts, putters]
[Grunting]
[Smacking] Ah...
[Mater] He's done.
He must've finished it
while we was all sleepin'.
Good riddance.
He's gone?
Well, we wouldn't want him
to miss that race of his.
[Sniffing]
- Oh, dude, are you crying?
- No! I'm happy!
I don't have to watch him
every second of the day anymore!
I'm glad he's gone!
[Blubbering, sobbing]
What's wrong with Red?
Oh, he's just sad
'cause you left town
and went to your big race to win
the Piston Cup
that you've always dreamed about
your whole life
and get that big ol' sponsor and that
fancy helicopter you was talkin' about.
[Gasping] Wait a minute!
[All laugh]
I knowed you wouldn't leave
without saying goodbye.
What are you doin' here?
You're gonna miss your race.
Don't worry. I'll give you
a police escort, and we'll make up time.
Thank you, Sheriff.
But you know I can't go just yet.
Well, why not?
- I'm not sure these tires...
- [Luigi gasps excitedly]
...can get me to California.
- Peet stop?
Yeah, does anybody know
what time Luigi's opens?
[Laughing] I can't-a believe it!
Four new tires!
[Laughing] I can't-a believe it!
Four new tires!
Grazie, Mr. Lightning. Grazie!
- Would you look at that!
- [Luigi] Our first customer in years!
I am filled with tears of ecstasy,
for this is the most glorious day
of my life!
All right, Luigi, give me
the best set of blackwalls you've got.
No! No, no, no.
You don't-a know what you want.
Luigi know what you want.
Blackwall tires.
They blend into the pavement.
But-a this...
Whitewall tires!
They say, "Look at me!
Here I am! Love me."
All right, you're the expert.
- [Snarling]
- [Lightning] Don't forget the spare.
- Perfetto. Guido!
- Peet stop!
[Chuck Berry: Route 66]
[Laughing] What did Luigi tell you, eh?
Wow, you were right.
Better than a Ferrari, huh?
Eh... No.
Wow! This organic fuel is great!
Why haven't I heard about it before?
It's a conspiracy, man!
The oil companies got a grip
on the government!
They're feedin' us a bunch of lies, man.
OK, I'll take a case.
Ow! Eh!
[Lightning yelps]
- [Chuckles]
- [Breathes in deeply]
[Ramone] Ah... Yeah.
[Lightning] Ka-chow.
- Here she comes!
- [Lightning] Places, everybody. Hurry!
- Act natural.
- [Whistling]
- Hi, Sally.
- Buon giorno!
All right, what's goin' on?
Ladies and gentlecars,
please welcome
the new Lightning McQueen!
Pow! What do you think?
Radiator Springs
looks pretty good on me.
[Chuckling] I'll say.
[Purring] Ka-chow.
You're gonna fit right in
in California.
My goodness. It looks like
you've helped everybody in town.
Yeah, everybody except one.
- Hey, is it getting dark out?
- What? What'd he say?
Let me say that again.
Is it getting dark out?
Now, what was I
supposed to do after that?
[The Chords: Sh-Boom]
[Gasping] They fixed their neon!
- Low and slow?
- Oh, yeah, baby! [chuckling]
[Flo laughs and shrieks]
Just like in its heyday, right?
It's even better than I pictured it.
Thank you.
[Chuckling]
Shall we cruise?
Oh, thank you, dear. I'd love to!
- No, no, no.
- Lizzie!
I remember when Stanley
first asked me to take a drive with him.
Hey, Miss Sally.
May I have this cruise?
- Of course, Mater.
- Uh-uh-uh!
[Mooing]
...and again and I said, "No."
He asked me again, and I said, "No."
But, oh, he was a persistent
little bugger for a two-cylinder.
Finally I said,
"All right, one little drive."
- Oh!
- [Mater chuckling]
- Hey!
- Thanks, Mater.
Good evenin', you two.
Oh, Stanley,
I wish you could see this.
- Is that what I think it is?
- Oh, I don't know, Flo.
I haven't had a chance to find out.
But I am going to find out. Hello.
Not that. That.
[Sally gasps] Customers?
[Sally gasps] Customers?
Customers, everybody!
And a lot of 'em!
You know what to do.
Just like we rehearsed.
[All gasp]
It's the ghostlight!
We have found McQueen.
We have found McQueen!
McQueen, over here!
- Wait, excuse me.
- Is it true you've been in rehab?
- Did you have a nervous breakdown?
- What?
- McQueen's wearing whitewalls!
- Your tires balding?
[Sally] Stickers!
- Was McQueen your prisoner?
- Shoot, no!
We're best buds!
I ain't braggin' or nothin',
but I was in charge of huntin' him down
if he tried to escape.
Sally! Sally!
Will you still race for the Piston Cup?
- Stickers?
- Sally!
- Come on, give us some bolt!
- [Horn honking]
You're here!
Thank the manufacturer! You're alive!
- Mack?
- You're here! I can't believe it!
[Chuckling] You are a sight
for sore headlights!
I'm so sorry I lost you, boss.
I'll make it up to you!
Mack, I, I can't believe you're here.
[Harv] Is that the world's
fastest racing machine?
- Is that Harv?
- Yeah. He's in the back.
- Show us the bolt!
- Get back, you oil-thirsty parasites!
- Where's the old McQueen?
- Actually, this is my good side here.
- Harv! Harv!
- Give us the bolt!
- Harv?
- Come on!
- Kid, I'm over here!
- How you doin', buddy?
My star client disappears
off the face of the earth!
- How do you think I'm doing?
- I can explain.
I'm doing great! You're everywhere!
Radio, TV, the papers!
You can't buy this kind of publicity!
What do you need me for?
That's just a figure of speech,
by the way. You signed a contract.
Where are you?
I can't even find you on my GPS.
I'm in this little town
called Radiator Springs.
- You know Route 66? It's still here!
- Yeah, that's great, kid.
Playtime is over, pal.
While the world's been trying to
find you Dinoco has had no one to woo.
- Who are they gonna woo?
- Chick!
Bingo. In fact, check out
what's on the plasma right now.
- Show us the thunder!
- You want thunder?
You want thunder?
Ka-chicka, ka-chicka!
- Hey, that's my bit!
- You've gotta get to Cali, pronto!
Just get out of Radiation Stinks now,
or Dinoco is history, you hear me?
Just give me a second here, Harv.
No, wait. Where are you goin'?
Get in the trailer, baby. Kid!
You want a bigger trailer?
Sally, I... I want you to...
Look, I wish... [sighs]
Thank you. Thanks for everything.
[Groans, chuckles]
- It was just a road.
- No. It was much more than that.
Hey, kid! We gotta go.
Harv's goin' crazy!
He's gonna have me fired if
I don't get you in the truck right now!
- Mack, just... hold it for...
- You should go.
- I know, but...
- Good luck in California.
I hope you find
what you're looking for.
- McQueen, come on!
- Sally...
- Sally!
- Show us the bolt, McQueen! The bolt!
Hey, Lightning, show us the bolt!
- Come on, get in the trailer.
- Where's the old McQueen?
- The bolt!
- That's it. That's right, let's go!
You're a big shining star.
You're a superstar.
You don't belong there, anyway.
Whoa... Wait...
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait!
[Engine starts]
Hey, guys!
McQueen's leavin' in the truck!
Hey, are you Doc Hudson?
- Yeah.
- Thanks for the call.
- You called them?
- It's best for everyone, Sally.
Best for everyone or best for you?
I didn't get to say goodbye to him.
[Light buzzing]
[Bob] Hello, race fans. Welcome
to what has become, quite simply,
the biggest event
in the history of racing.
A three-way battle for the Piston Cup!
[Darrell] There's a crowd
of nearly 200,000 cars
here at the Los Angeles
International Speedway.
Tickets to this race are hotter than a
black leather seat on a hot summer day!
[Bob] The King, Chick Hicks
and Lightning McQueen
in a 200 lap, winner-takes-all,
tiebreaker race.
[Darrell] I got a lotta miles on me,
but let me tell you somethin'.
I never thought I'd see anything
like this. This is exciting!
[Bob] In fact, the country
has almost shut down
to watch what many experts
are calling "the race of the century."
Hey, King!
Good luck in your last race.
- You've sure been an inspiration to me.
- Thanks, Junior. Appreciate it.
- Hey, be careful out there, OK?
- Yeah, man.
[Mia] He's hot!
Wanna know the forecast?
I'll give you the forecast.
A 100 percent chance of thunder!
Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!
Say it with me!
Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!
Hey, you! No admittance
without a garage pass.
Oh, it's OK.
Lightning McQueen knows me!
Hey, Marco, it's a beautiful day
for a race, isn't it?
- Absolutely, Mr. Andretti.
- And good morning to you, Fred.
Mario Andretti knows my name!
You gotta let me in now!
[Guard] Sorry, pal.
[Lightning] OK, here we go.
Focus. Speed.
I am speed.
[Cars whizzing]
Victory.
One winner, two losers.
[Engine rewing]
Speed. Speed. Speed. Speed...
[birds singing]
[Knock on door]
[Mack] Lightnin'! You ready?
[Gasping] Yeah, yeah, yeah! I'm ready.
[Indistinct chatter]
Mack, thanks for being
my pit crew today.
Don't worry about it, kid.
It's the least I could do.
After all, "Gas Can"
is my middle name.
- It is?
- Ah... Not really.
[All shouting]
[Gulping]
Uh-oh
- [cheering, laughing]
- [Giggling]
Nelson! Zoom in.
Ready, 16? Take 16.
[Bob] And there he is,
Lightning McQueen!
Missing all week, and then he turns up
in the middle of nowhere!
In a little town
called Radiator Springs.
[Darrell] Wearin' whitewall tires,
of all things.
- Oh!
- Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!
[Chuckling]
Hey, where you been?
I've been kinda lonely.
Nobody to hang out with.
I mean, except the Dinoco folks.
And the twins. Of course.
The ones that used to be your fans,
but now they're my fans.
Listen to what the twins think...
Agh! Shoot!
[Darrell] Boogity, boogity, boogity,
boys! Let's go racin'!
[Crowd cheering]
Come on, you can do it!
Come on, King, make us proud, boy!
[Bob] Fifty laps down, and The King
is still holding a slim lead.
[Darrell] McQueen's got a run on him!
He's lookin' to the inside!
Oh! Chick slammed the door on him!
[Bob] Chick's not
making it easy on him today.
[Darrell] He lost momentum,
and now he's gonna have to
chase him back down!
- [Soft music]
- [Birds singing]
[Breaks squealing]
[Bob] McQueen spins out in the infield!
[All gasp]
[Chuckling] Just me
and the old man, fellas.
- McQueen just doesn't have it today.
- [All laugh]
[Groans]
- Hey, kid, are you all right?
- I don't know, Mack.
I don't think I...
[Doc] I didn't come all this way
to see you quit.
Doc?
Guys, you're here!
I can't believe this!
I knew you needed a crew chief,
but I didn't know it was this bad.
You said you'd never come back.
Well, I really didn't have a choice.
Mater didn't get to say goodbye.
Goodbye! OK, I'm good.
[Chuckles]
All right, if you can drive as good
as you can fix a road
then you can win this race
with your eyes shut.
Now, get back out there!
Hot snot, we are back in business!
Guido! Luigi!
You're goin' up
against professional pit crews.
- You're gonna have to be fast.
- They will not know what bit them!
Kid, you can beat these guys.
Find a groove that works for you
and get that lap back.
[Murmuring]
- Is it?
- Oh, wow. That's him!
Is that...? That's the Hudson Hornet!
The Hudson Hornet's back!
[Bob] It appears McQueen
has got himself a pit crew.
And look who he has for a crew chief!
- Look, man. It's the Hudson Hornet!
- Whoa!
Well, dip me in axle grease
and call me Slick! It surely is.
[Crowd cheering]
[Bob] Wow, this is history
in the making.
Nobody has seen the racing legend
in over 50 years!
Hey, Doc!
Come look at this fellow on the radio.
He looks just like you.
- [Bob] McQueen passes on the inside!
- [Darrell] He's nearly a lap down.
[Bob] Can he catch up to them
with only 60 laps to go?
You're goin' great, kid.
Just keep your head on.
Vai! Vai, vai!
Hey, shrimpie,
where did McQueen find you, huh?
Those round things are called tires,
and they go under the car!
[All laugh]
Con chi credi di parlare?
Ma, con chi stai parlando?
No! No, no! You'll have your chance.
You will have your chance.
Oh, kid's just tryin'
to be a hero, huh?
What do you think of this?
- [Tires squealing]
- Yeah, that's it, kid.
What?
Whoa! Git-R-done!
- [Laughing] I taught him that. Ka-chow!
- Ah!
[Bob] What a move by McQueen!
He's caught up to the leaders.
Yeah. This is what it's all about.
A three-way battle for the lead,
with ten to go!
[Chortling]
Look at that boy go out there!
[Chick] Oh! [grunting]
No, you don't.
[Tire blows]
Doc, I'm flat! I'm flat!
- Can you get back to the pits?
- Yeah, yeah. I think so.
Hey, got a yellow. Bring it in.
Don't tear yourself up, kid.
[Mack] We gotta get him
back out there fast
or we're gonna be a lap down,
and we'll never win this race!
Guido! It's time.
Hey, tiny,
you gonna clean his windshield?
[Air wrench whirring]
[Darrell] I don't believe it!
[Bob] That was
the fastest pit stop I've ever seen!
[Darrell] It was a great stop,
but he's still gotta beat that pace car!
[Bob] It's gonna be close.
- Yeah, baby!
- [All hollering]
[Darrell] He's back in!
Peet stop.
- Guido, you did it!
- Way to go, Guido!
[Bob] This is it. We're heading into
the final lap and McQueen
is right behind the leaders.
What a comeback!
[Darrell] A hundred and ninety-nine
laps! It all comes down to this!
This is it, kiddo.
You've got four turns left.
One at a time.
Drive it in deep and hope it sticks.
- Go!
- [Rewing]
We'll see about that!
[Bob] McQueen's going inside!
- Chick and King are loose!
- [Darrell] I think McQueen's out!
- McQueen saved it!
- [Bob] He's back on the track!
- Float like a Cadillac...
- Sting like a Beemer!
- Ka-chow! Ka-chow! Ka...
- [all cheer]
[Darrell] Lightning McQueen
is gonna win the Piston Cup!
Come on! You got it!
You got it, Stickers!
[Grunts] I am not comin' in
behind you again, old man.
- Oh, no!
- [Crowd gasps]
[Breaks screeching]
[Engine idling]
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!
I won, baby! Yeah! Oh, yeah!
[Flo] What's he up to, Doc?
[Grunting, moaning]
What are you doin', kid?
I think The King
should finish his last race.
You just gave up the Piston Cup,
you know that?
This grumpy old racecar I know
once told me somethin'.
It's just an empty cup.
[Bob] Darrell, is pushing
on the last lap legal?
He's not really pushin' him. He's
just givin' him a little bump draft.
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Hey. What? What's goin' on?
- That's what I call racin'.
- [Sobbing]
[Laughing]
[Crowd cheers wildly]
- Bravo il mio amico!
- Way to go, buddy!
There's a lotta love out there,
you know, man?
- Don't embarrass me, Fillmore.
- That's my hot rod.
Come on, baby, bring it out!
Bring out the Piston Cup!
Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!
Yeah!
Now, that's what I'm talkin' about!
Hey, how come the only one celebrating
is me, huh?
Where are the girls?
Bring on the confetti!
Ow! Ow! Easy with the confetti.
What's goin' on?
Come on, snap some pictures.
I gotta go sign my deal with Dinoco!
Say it with me. Ka-chicka!
- Boo!
- Boo!
What's wrong with everybody?
Where's the happiness?
Hey! This is the start of the Chick era!
- Thanks, Lightnin'.
- You're welcome.
- Way to go, King!
- You're still the car!
You're The King! Yeah!
[Crowd cheers]
[Laughing and cheering]
- You made us proud, kid!
- Congrats on the loss, me bucko!
You got a lotta stuff, kid.
Thanks, Doc.
Hey, Lightnin'.
How 'bout comin' over here
and talk to me a minute?
Son, that was some
real racin' out there.
How'd you like to become
the new face of Dinoco?
But I didn't win.
Lightnin', there's a whole lot
more to racin' than just winnin'.
[Clank] He was so rusty,
when he drove down the street
- buzzards used to circle the car!
- [All laugh]
Thank you, Mr. Tex, but...
...but these Rust-eze guys over there
gave me my big break.
I'm gonna stick with them.
Well, I sure can respect that.
Still, you know,
if there's ever anything
I can do for you, just let me know.
I sure appreciate that.
Thank you.
Actually, there is one thing.
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo-hoo!
Hey, look at me!
I'm flyin', by golly!
I'm happier than a tornado
in a trailer park!
I think it's about-a time
we redecorate.
Hi. Lightning McQueen told me
this was the best place in the world
to get tires.
How 'bout setting me and my friends up
with three or four sets each?
Guido! There is a real
Michael Schumacher Ferrari in my store.
A real Ferrari!
Punch me, Guido.
Punch me in the face.
This is the most glorious day
of my life.
Wow. [Italian]
Spero che il tuo amico si riprenda.
Mi dicono che siete fantastici.
- [Sighing]
- [Engine rewing]
[Both chuckle]
Just passin' through?
Actually, I thought I'd stop
and stay awhile.
- I hear this place is back on the map.
- It is?
There's some rumor floating around
that some hotshot Piston Cup racecar
is setting up his big
racing headquarters here.
Really? Ah, well, there goes the town.
You know, I really missed you, Sally.
Well, I create feelings in others
they themselves don't understand and,
- blah, blah, blah.
- [Lightning chuckles]
McQueen and Sally
parked beneath the tree,
K- i-s-s... uh... i- n-t!
Great timing, Mater!
Hep-non, hip-hep, hi-li-lilly! Whee!
He's my best friend.
What're you gonna do?
So, Stickers, last one to Flo's buys?
I don't know.
Why don't we just take a drive?
Hmm... Nah.
Yeah! Ka-chow!
[John Mayer: Route 66]
[Yelling]
[Sirens blaring]
[Sniffing] Ah-choo!
[Mater] All right, everybody
please keep together now.
We is now entering the Doc Hudson
wing of the museum.
Wow. Unbelievable.
That many wins in a single season.
He's the real deal, Junior.
The Hudson Hornet was my inspiration.
Excuse me, son.
Is Doc Hudson here today?
Sorry, Mrs. The King, I think Doc
went out for a drive or somethin'.
- [Lightning] Whoo! Whoo!
- [Doc] Yeah!
Well, you sure ain't no dirt boy.
Not today, old man.
I know all your tricks.
[Growls]
Doc! Doc!
Whoo-ah!
[Doc] Not all my tricks, rookie!
[All grumble]
[Cheering]
Attention!
Kiss the pavement goodbye.
When I'm finished, you'll have mud
in places you didn't know you had!
- Yo, I've never been off-road!
- Well, that's gonna change right now!
About face!
Drop and give me 20 miles!
Go! Go!
Go, go, go, go, go! Go!
Man, now I got dirt in my rims!
- [Pole hits metal]
- Huh? Look at this!
It's my hood! It's my hood!
I ain't seen this thing in 20 years!
Well, it fits perfectly.
How do I look? Ah-choo!
Oh, dang.
You are a toy car!
You are a sad, strange little wagon
and you have my pity. Farewell.
[Woody Car] Oh, yeah?
Well, good riddance, you loony!
Hey, I hate to break up the road rally,
guys, but they're here!
Birthday guests at three o'clock!
[Chuckling] Oh, man! Whoever does
the voice of that piggy truck,
I'm tellin' ya, he's one great actor!
We're banished, genius! Stuck here
in this wasteland without chains!
But, Mike, the Boomobile's in trouble!
She needs our help!
- You're still not listening! [gasping]
- Ah!
Welcome to the Himalayas!
Snow cone?
Oh, that Abominable Snowplow
is quite the comic thespian!
Just get in there.
Go! Go, go, go!
Circus cars?
How can you be circus cars?
These are the lousiest
circus cars in the world,
and they're gonna make me rich!
Wait a minute here.
They're just usin' the same actor
over and over.
What kind of a cut-rate production
is this?
[Brad Paisley: Find Yourself]
[Minny moaning]
Oh, for the love of Chrysler, can we
please ask someone for directions?
No! There's an on-ramp close!
I know it! I can feel it!


This is Agent Leland Turbo.
I have a flash transmission
for Agent Finn McMissile.
Finn, my cover's been compromised.
Everything's gone pear-shaped.
You won't believe what I found out here.
This is bigger than anything we've ever
seen, and no one even knows it exists.
Finn, I need backup, but don't call
the cavalry, it could blow the operation.
- And be careful. It's not safe out here.
Let's go.
Transmitting my grids now. Good luck.
All right, buddy, we're here.
Right where you paid me to bring you.
Question is, why?
I'm looking for a car.
A car? Ha!
Hey, pal, you can't get any further away
from land than out here.
Exactly where I want to be.
I got news for you, buddy.
There's nobody out here but us.
What are you doing out here?
What does it look like, genius?
I'm crabbing.
Well, turn around
and go back where you came from.
Yeah, and who's gonna make me?
All right. All right.
Don't get your prop in a twist.
What a jerk. Sorry, buddy.
Looks like it's the end of the line.
Buddy?
Incoming.
All workers report to the loading dock.
Leland Turbo, this is Finn McMissile.
I'm at the rally point. Over.
All right, fellas, you know the drill.
Leland, it's Finn. Please respond. Over.
Come on, guys. These crates
aren't gonna unload themselves.
Too many cars here. Out of my way.
Professor Zndapp?
Here it is, Professor. You wanted to
see this before we load it?
Ah, yes. Very carefully.
Oh, a TV camera.
- What does it actually do?
- This camera is extremely dangerous.
What are you up to now, Professor?
This is valuable equipment. Make sure
it is properly secured for the voyage.
- You got it.
- Hey, Professor Z!
This is one of those
British spies we told you about.
Yeah! This one we caught sticking
his bumper where it didn't belong.
Agent Leland Turbo.
It's Finn McMissile!
He's seen the camera! Kill him!
All hands on deck!
All hands on deck!
Whoa!
Waargh!
What?
Get to the boats!
- He's getting away!
- Not for long!
He's dead, Professor.
Wunderbar!
With Finn McMissile gone,
who can stop us now?
Mater -Tow Mater, that's who -
is here to help you.
- Hey, Otis!
- Hey, Mater.
I... Oh, gosh. I'm so sorry.
I thought I could make it this time, but...
Smooth like pudding, huh?
Who am I kidding?
I'll always be a lemon.
Well, dad-gum, you're leaking oil again.
Must be your gaskets.
Hey, but look on the bright side.
This is your tenth tow this month,
so it's on the house.
You're the only one
that's nice to lemons like me, Mater.
Don't sweat it. Shoot,
these things happen to everybody.
- But you never leak oil.
- Yeah, but I ain't perfect.
Don't tell nobody, but I think my rust
is starting to show through.
Hey. Is Lightning McQueen back yet?
Not yet.
He must be crazy excited
about winning his fourth Piston Cup.
Four! Wow!
Yeah, we're so dad-gum proud of him,
but I wish he'd hurry up and get back,
'cause we got a whole summer's worth
of best friend fun to make up for.
Just me and...
McQueen!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- McQueen!
- Mater! I'm in no hurry!
- Hey, everybody. McQueen's back!
- Aaah!
- McQueen's back!
- McQueen's back! McQueen's back!
- Aaah! Oooh-hoo! Oooh-hah!
McQueen's back!
Oh, Lightning! Welcome home!
- Good to have you back, honey!
- Congratulations, man.
Welcome home, soldier.
The place wasn't the same without you,
son.
What? Did he go somewhere?
It's good to be home, everybody.
- Mater!
- McQueen!
Oooh!
Whoooa!
Hey,
how far did you make it this time, Otis?
- Halfway to the county line.
- Ooh, not bad, man!
I know! I can't believe it either!
- McQueen! Welcome back!
- Mater, it's so good to see you.
You too, buddy.
Oh, man, you ain't going to believe
the things I got planned for us!
These best friend greetings
get longer every year!
- You ready to have some serious fun?
- I've got something to show you first.
Wow.
I can't believe
they renamed the Piston Cup
after our very own Doc Hudson.
I know Doc said these things
were just old cups,
but to have someone else win it
just didn't feel right, you know?
Doc would've been real proud of you.
That's for sure.
All right, pal.
I've been waiting all summer for this.
- What you got planned?
- Ho-ho-ho! You sure you can handle it?
Do you know who you're talking to?
This is Lightning McQueen!
I can handle anything.
Er... Mater?
Just remember, your brakes
ain't going to work on these!
- Mater?
- Relax.
These train tracks
ain't been used in years!
Aaaah!
- Aaaah!
- Faster, faster. Come on. Here we go!
Faster!
Ooh. Wow.
Yeah, I don't know. Do you think?
This is going to be good!
Did you see that?
Uh-oh.
This ain't going to be good.
Ha-ha! Boy, this was the best day ever!
And my favorite souvenir,
this new dent.
- Boy, Mater, today was ah...
- Shoot, that was nothing.
Wait till you see
what I got planned for tonight!
Mater, Mater, whoa!
I was thinking of just a quiet dinner.
That's exactly what I was thinkin'.
- No, I meant with Sally, Mater.
- Even better!
You, me and Miss Sally
goin' out for supper.
Mater, I meant it would be
just me and Sally.
- Oh.
- You know, just for tonight.
- Oh...
- We'll do whatever you want tomorrow.
OK.
- Thanks for understanding.
- Yeah, sure.
- Y'all go on and have fun now.
- All right, then.
See you soon, amigo.
Ah, this is so nice.
I can't tell you how good it is
to be here alone,
just the two of us, finally.
- You and me.
Ahem! Good evening.
- Oh!
- My name is Mater,
and I'll be your waiter.
Mater the waiter.
That's funny right there.
Mater? You work here?
Yeah, I work here. What'd you think?
I snuck in here
when nobody was lookin'
and pretended to be your waiter
so I could hang out with you?
Oh, yeah.
How ridiculous would that be?
Can I start you two lovebirds off
with a couple of drinks?
- Yes. I'll have my usual.
- You know what? I'll have that, too.
Uh... Right. Your usual.
- Thanks, man.
- Grazie, Guido.
Guido, what's McQueen's usual?
How should I know?
- Perfect. Give me two of them.
- Quiet! My program's on.
Tonight on the Mel Dorado Show...
His story gripped the world.
Oil billionaire Miles Axlerod,
in an attempt to become the first car to
circumnavigate the globe without GPS,
ironically ran out of gas,
and found himself trapped in the wild.
Feared dead, he emerged 36 days later,
running on a fuel he distilled himself
from the natural elements!
Since then, he's sold his oil fortune,
converted himself from a gas-guzzler
into an electric car
and has devoted his life to finding
a renewable, clean-burning fuel.
Now he claims to have done it
with his allinol.
And to show the world
what his new super fuel can do
he's created a racing competition
like no other,
inviting the greatest champions
to battle in the first ever
World Grand Prix.
Welcome, Sir Miles Axlerod.
Thank you, Mel. It is good to be here.
Listen to me.
Big oil. It costs a fortune.
Pollution is getting worse.
I mean, it's a fossil fuel.
"Fossil," as in dead dinosaurs.
And we all know
what happened to them.
Alternative energy is the future.
Trust me, Mel.
After seeing allinol in action
at the World Grand Prix,
nobody will ever go back
to gasoline again.
What happened to the dinosaurs, now?
And on satellite,
a World Grand Prix competitor
and one of the fastest cars in the world,
Francesco Bernoulli.
It is an honor, Signore Dorado,
for you.
Why not invite Lightning McQueen?
Of course we invited him,
but apparently after his very long
racing season
he is taking time off to rest.
The Lightning McQueen would not
have a chance against Francesco.
I can go over 300 kilometers an hour.
In miles, that is like...
way faster than McQueen.
Let's go to the phones.
Baltimore, Maryland, you're on the air.
- Am I on? Hello?
- You're on. Go ahead.
- Hello?
- Go ahead.
Let's go to Radiator Springs.
You're on, caller.
That Italian feller
you got on there
can't talk that way about
Lightning McQueen.
He's the bestest race car
in the whole wide world.
- Uh-oh.
- If he is, how you say,
"the bestest race car,"
then why must he rest? Huh?
'Cause he knows
what's important.
Every now and then he prefers
just to slow down, enjoy life.
Oh! You heard it!
Lightning McQueen prefers to be slow!
This is not news to Francesco.
When I want to go to sleep,
I watch one of his races.
After two laps, I am out cold.
That ain't what I meant.
McQUEEN: What's going on
over there?
He is afraid of Francesco.
McQUEEN: That's that
Italian formula car.
- His name is...
- Francesco Bernoulli.
- No wonder there's a crowd.
- Why do you know his name?
And don't say it like that.
It's three syllables, not ten.
What? He's nice to look at.
You know, open-wheeled and all.
What's wrong with fenders?
I thought you liked my fenders.
- Let me tell you something else.
- Mater?
McQueen could drive circles
around you.
Driving in circles is all he can-a do, no?
No.
I mean, yes.
I mean, he could beat you anywhere.
Any time, any track.
Mel, can we move on?
Francesco needs a caller
who can provide
a little more intellectual stimulation,
like a dump truck.
Ha-ha! That shows what you know.
Dump trucks is dumb.
Hey! Whoa!
Yeah, hi. This is Lightning McQueen.
The Lightning McQueen, huh?
I don't appreciate my best friend
being insulted like that.
McQueen, that was your best friend?
Oh!
This is the difference
between you and Francesco.
Francesco knows how good he is.
He does not need to surround himself
with tow trucks to prove it.
Those are strong words
from a car that is so fragile.
Fragile! He calls Francesco fragile!
Not-a so fast, McQueen!
"Not so fast."
Is that your new motto?
Motto?
This sounds like something that needs
to be settled on the race course.
What do you say, Lightning McQueen?
We've got room for one more racer.
I would love to,
but my crew is off for the season, so...
Pit stop.
You know what? They just got back.
Deal me in, baby.
Ka-chow! Yeah.
I know, I know.
I just got back, but we won't be long.
No, don't worry about me.
I've got enough to do here.
Mater's going to have a blast, though.
You're bringing Mater, right?
You never bring him
to any of your races.
Ah.
Just let him sit in the pits.
Give him a headset.
Come on, it will be
the thrill of a lifetime for him.
- Your drink, sir.
- Mater.
I didn't taste it!
How'd you like to come
and see the world with me?
- You mean it?
- Yeah. You got me into this thing.
- You're coming along.
- All right!
Ka-chow!
Ha-ha!
Hey!
Hey, excuse me!
Domo arigato!
Yeah!
Guido, look. Ferraris and tires.
- Let's go!
- Ho-ho! Look at this.
OK, now, Mater, remember,
best behavior.
- You got it, buddy. Hey, what's that?
- Mater!
Hey, McQueen! Over here.
- Lewis!
- Hey, man.
- Jeff!
- Hey, Lightning.
Can you believe this party?
Hey.
You done good. You got all the leaves.
- Check out that tow truck.
- Man, I wonder who that guy's with.
Ah... Will you guys excuse me
just for one little second?
Ho-ho! Good job!
Mater!
Listen, this isn't Radiator Springs.
You're just realizing that?
Oh-ho! That jet lag really done
a number on you.
Mater, things are different over here.
Which means maybe you should,
you know, act a little different, too.
- Different than what?
- Well, just help me out here.
You need help? Shoot!
Why didn't you say so?
That's what a tow truck does.
- Yeah, I mean...
- Looky there.
It's Mr. San Francisco.
I'll introduce you.
- Mater, no!
- Look at me. I'm helping you already.
Hey, Mr. San Francisco,
I'd like you to meet...
Ah, Lightning McQueen! Buona sera.
- Nice to meet you, Francesco.
- Nice to meet you, too.
You are very good-looking.
Not as good as I thought, but good.
Excuse me.
Can I get a picture with you?
Anything for McQueen's friend.
Miss Sally is going to flip
when she sees this.
She's Lightning McQueen's girlfriend.
- Oooh!
- She's a big fan of yours.
Hey, she has-a good taste.
Mater's prone to exaggeration.
I wouldn't say she's a "big fan".
You're right. She's a huge fan!
She goes on and on
about your open wheels.
Mentioning it once doesn't qualify
as going on and on.
Francesco is familiar
with this reaction to Francesco.
Women respect a car
that has-a nothing to hide.
Yeah, er...
- Let us have a toast.
- Let's.
I dedicate my win tomorrow
to Miss Sally.
Oh. Sorry.
I already dedicated
my win tomorrow to her.
So, if we both do it,
it's really not so special.
- Besides, I don't have a drink.
- I'll go get you one.
Do you mind if I borrow a few bucks
for one of them drinks?
- They're free.
- Free? Shoot, what am I doing here?
I should probably go keep an eye
on him. See you at the race.
Yes, you will see Francesco,
but not like this.
You will see him like-a this
as he drives away from you.
Ha! That's cute.
You had one of those made up
for all the racers?
No.
Okay.
- Ciao, McQueen!
- He is so getting beat tomorrow!
Ladies and gentlecars,
Sir Miles Axlerod.
It is my absolute honor
to introduce to you
the competitors in the first ever
World Grand Prix.
From Brazil, Number 8...
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.
A Volkswagen Karmann Ghia
has no radiator.
That's because it's air-cooled.
Great. I'm Agent Shiftwell.
Holley Shiftwell from the Tokyo station.
- I have a message from London.
- Not here.
Try the canaps on the mezzanine.
The lab boys analyzed the photo I sent?
What did they learn about the camera?
It appears to be
a standard television camera.
They said if you could get closer
photos next time that would be great.
This was London's message?
Oh, no. No, sir.
The oil platforms you were on,
turns out they're sitting on
the biggest oil reserve in the world.
How did we miss that?
They've scrambled
everyone's satellites.
The Americans discovered it
just before you did.
They placed an agent on that platform
under deep cover.
He was able to get a photo of the car
who's running the entire operation.
Great.
Who is it?
Has anyone seen the photo yet?
Nope, not yet.
The American is here tonight
to pass it to you.
He'll signal you when he's ready.
Good, good.
Oh, no.
- What is it?
- Change of plan.
- You're meeting the American.
- What? Me?
Those thugs down there
were on the oil platform.
If they see me,
the mission is compromised.
No, I'm technical. I'm in diagnostics.
I'm... I'm not a field agent.
You are now.
I'll take one of them. Thank you.
Never know which one McQueen
will have a hankering for.
Hey. What you got here that's free?
How about that pistachio ice cream?
- No, no, wasabi.
- Same old same old.
What's up with you?
That looks delicious!
Er... little more, please.
It is free, right?
Keep it coming. A little more.
Come on, let's go. It's free.
You're gettin' there. Scoop, scoop.
There ya go!
Now that's a scoop of ice cream!
My condolences.
And now our last competitor.
Number 95, Lightning McQueen!
Ka-chow!
Thank you so much for having us,
Sir Axlerod.
I really look forward to racing.
This is a great opportunity.
Oh, the pleasure is all ours, Lightning.
You and your team bring
excellence and professionalism
to this competition.
Somebody get me water! Aah!
Oh, sweet relief. Sweet relief.
Whatever you do,
do not eat the free pistachio ice cream.
It has turned.
Sir Axlerod, I can explain.
- This is Mater. He's...
- I know him.
This is the bloke that called in
to the television show.
- You're the one I have to thank.
- No, thank you.
This trip's been amazin'.
Ah. He's a little excited, isn't he?
- Mater!
- But wait, I... Oh, shoot.
- Mater.
- Has anyone got a towel?
Mater, get a hold of yourself.
You're making a scene!
- But I never leak oil. Never.
- Go take care of yourself right now!
Comin' through! Leakin' oil.
Where's the bathroom? Thank you.
I gotta go. Oh, er...
Er...
Sorry, ladies.
I'm leakin'. I never leak. I never leak.
I never leak, I never leak, I never leak.
Oh, oh, I never leak. Oooh!
I never leak, I never leak, never...
Wow-wee!
What in the?
Hey, that tickles!
Waaargh!
Okay, McMissile. I'm here.
It's time for the drop.
OK, so, the American has activated
his tracking beacon.
Roger that. Move in.
Stop! Hey!
- Oh, you've got to be joking.
- What's the problem?
- He's in the loo.
- So, go in!
- I can't go into the men's loo!
- Time is of the essence.
All right.
Oh! Whatever you do,
I would not go in there!
Hey! A Gremlin and a Pacer!
No offense to your makes and models,
but you break down harder
than my cousin Betsy
after she got left at the altar!
What the? Whoa. Are you OK?
- I'm fine.
- Hey! Tow truck!
We'd like to get to our private business
here, if you don't mind.
Oh, yeah, sorry.
Don't let me get in the way
of your private business.
Oh, a little advice. When you hear
a giggle and see that waterfall,
you best press that green button.
- Thank you.
- It's to adjust the temperature.
- Got it.
- And it's in Celsius, not Fahrenheit.
Get out of here!
All right, then. And when she starts
gigglin', prepare to be squirted.
'Scuse me, ma'am.
Dad-gum pistachio ice cream.
- This cannot be him.
Is he American?
Look out, ladies.
Mater's fittin' to get funky.
- Extremely.
- Then it's him.
- Hello.
- Well, hello.
A Volkswagen Karmann Ghia
has no radiator.
Well, of course it doesn't.
That's 'cause it's air-cooled.
Perfect.
Erm... I'm from the Tokyo Station.
'Course, Karmann Ghias
weren't the only ones.
Besides the Beetles, you had Type 3
Squarebacks with the Pancake motors.
- Yeah, OK. I get it.
- And before both of them
there's the Type 2 buses.
- My buddy Fillmore's one of them.
- Listen!
Erm... We should find somewhere
more private.
Gee, don't you think that's a little?
You're right. Impossible to know
which areas here are compromised.
- So, when can I see you again?
- Well, let's see.
- Tomorrow I'll be out there at the races.
- Got it.
We'll rendezvous then.
- There you are. Where have you been?
- What's a "rendezvous"?
- Er... It's like a date.
- A date?
Mater, what's going on?
What's going on is
I got me a date tomorrow.
Guido don't believe you.
Believe it.
My new girlfriend just said so.
Hey, there she is. Hey! Hey, lady!
See you tomorrow!
Guido still don't believe you.
- I got to admit, you tricked us real good.
- And we don't like being tricked.
What's so funny?
Well, I was just wearing a disguise.
You guys are stuck looking like that.
Allinol? Thanks, fellas.
I hear this stuff is good for you.
So you think.
Allinol by itself is good for you.
But after microscopic examination
I have found
that it has one small weakness.
When hit with
an electromagnetic pulse,
it becomes extremely dangerous.
Smile for the camera.
Is that all you want? I got a whole act.
You were very interested in this camera
on the oil platform.
Now, you will witness
what it really does.
- Whatever you say, Professor.
- You talked up a lot of cars last night.
- Which one's your associate?
- Your mother.
Oh, no, I'm sorry, it was your sister.
I can't tell them apart these days.
Could I start it now, Professor Z?
Go 50% power.
This camera is actually
an electromagnetic pulse emitter.
What about her? Did you give it to her?
The allinol is now heating to a boil,
dramatically expanding, causing the
engine block to crack under the stress,
forcing oil
into the combustion chamber.
How about him? Did you talk to him?
What do I care?
I can replace an engine block.
You may be able to,
but after full impact of the pulse...
unfortunately...
there will be nothing to replace.
How about him?
Does he have it?
That's him. He's the one.
- Roger that, Professor Z.
- No!
Yes, sir.
We believe the infiltrator has passed
along sensitive information.
I will take care of it
before any damage can be done.
The project is still on schedule.
You will find the second agent
and kill him.
Japan, land of the rising sun,
where ancient tradition
meets modern technology.
Welcome to the inaugural running
of the World Grand Prix.
I'm Brent Mustangburger
with racing legends
Darrell Cartrip and David Hobbscap.
There's never been a competition
like this before.
First, allinol, making its debut tonight
as the required fuel
for all these great champions.
Second, the course itself.
And it's like nothing
we've ever seen before.
David, how exactly
does this competition work?
All three of these street courses are
classic round-the-house racetracks.
This means that the LMP
and formula cars
should break out of the gate
in spectacular fashion.
Look for Francesco Bernoulli,
in particular, to lead early.
And with technical turns throughout,
GT and touring cars,
like Spain's Miguel Camino,
should make up ground
but I doubt it'll be enough
to stop Francesco
from absolutely running away with it.
Whoa now. Hold your horsepower.
You forget the most important factor...
that early dirt track section
of the course.
The dirt is supposed to be
the equalizer in this race.
French rally car Raoul aRoule
is counting on a big boost
through there.
And don't forget
Lightning McQueen.
His mentor, the Hudson Hornet,
was one of the greatest
dirt track racers of all time.
In my opinion, McQueen is the best
all-around racer in this competition.
Really, Darrell, you need
to clean your windshield.
You're clearly not seeing this
for what it is: Francesco's race to lose.
It's time to find out.
The racers are locking into the grid.
McQUEEN: Speed. I am speed.
Really? You are speed?
Then Francesco is triple speed.
Francesco is triple speed.
Ho-ho! Francesco likes-a this McQueen.
It's-a really getting him into the zone.
He is so getting beat today.
- Your suspension sets look good.
- Tire pressure is excellent!
- He's got plenty of fuel.
- And he's awesome.
- Why is he in the pits? He's so exposed.
- It's his cover.
One of the best I've seen, too.
Look at the detail on that rust.
It must have cost him a fortune.
- But why hasn't he contacted us yet?
- There's probably heat on him.
- Be patient.
- Right, of course.
- He'll signal us when he can.
- Then we find out who's behind all this.
As they head into the palace
hairpin, Francesco builds an early lead.
Hang on, boys.
Here comes the dirt.
Slipping and sliding, baby.
McQueen,
it's time to make your move!
Get on the outside
and show 'im what Doc taught you.
Oh, boy! Francesco's brought
to a screeching halt!
Lightning McQueen
is the first to take advantage.
And just like that, folks,
Francesco's lead is left in the dust.
McQUEEN: Nice call, Mater.
Keep it up.
Whoo-hoo!
McQueen looks happier than a roll bar
at a demolition derby!
Everyone's jostling for position
as we hit the asphalt again.
Francesco lost a lot of momentum
in the dirt.
He's got serious work ahead of
him if he wants to get back in this race.
The racers hit the Rainbow
Bridge, with its 360-degree loop.
It is time.
- Roger that.
Oh!
Miguel Camino has blown an engine!
Very unusual, Darrell.
He's been so consistent all year.
- You gotta be kidding me.
- What is it?
- The tow truck from the bathroom.
- The bathroom?
The one the American agent
passed the device to.
- What about him?
- He's in the pits!
Not for long.
- Hold on. I think I've got something.
- What is it?
The Pacer from the party last night.
I'm cross-referencing with the photos
from the oil derricks.
Yep. His VIN numbers match.
Anyone with him?
He won't be alone.
Conducting analysis on the target.
He's not the only one here.
Three, five... They're everywhere.
And they're all closing in on...
Oh, no! Finn? Finn, where are you?
Get him out of the pits. Now!
Wow! Some of them fellers
is really loud!
Can you hear me? Over.
- What?
Get out of the pit now! Do you hear me?
Hey. I know you! You're that girl
from the party last night.
You wanna do our date now?
Guys, too much chatter.
Let's keep this line clear.
Smoke from number 10,
Clutchgoneski!
Ha-ha-ha!
There's no time for
messing about! Get out of the pits!
Is there going to be cable where you is
so I can watch the rest of the race?
You're running out of time!
- They're coming. Get him out of there!
I'm trying. Get out now.
I usually like to have a proper detailin'
done before I meet a lady friend.
Huh?
- Finn McMissile! But you're dead!
- Then this shouldn't hurt.
Miss Shiftwell?
I've got him in the back alleys
east of the garages.
Multiple assailants
are closing in quickly.
Keep him moving. I'm on my way.
Hey, new lady friend,
you like flowers?
What?
No! Don't go in anywhere.
Just keep moving.
- Stay outside. Got you.
- Outside?
Whoa! McQueen
suddenly moves to the outside.
I cannot believe what I saw.
That was a bonehead move
to open up the inside like that!
That might have cost McQueen
the victory!
This time, I'm going to make sure
you stay dead!
You're doing brilliantly.
Now just stay focused.
What's that? You want me
to head toward that ruckus?
No! Don't go down that street.
Ohh!
Hi-yah!
Wow! A live karate demonstration!
Stop it, Mater. Just sign off.
Aaargh!
And here they come,
the two leaders.
Bumper to bumper
as they approach the finish line!
- It's close!
Francesco's the winner!
McQueen's number two.
That was cool!
Can I get your autograph?
Where'd he go?
Our rendezvous has been
jeopardized. Keep the device safe.
- We'll be in touch.
- Dad-gum, did I miss our date?
- Francesco!
- Francesco, over here.
What was your strategy today?
Strategia?
Francesco needs-a no strategy.
It's-a very simple.
You start the race, wait for Lightning
McQueen to choke, pass him, then win.
Francesco always-a wins. It's-a boring.
You were in trouble
for a while.
That dirt track section
had you crawling.
To truly crush one's dream, you must
first raise their hopes very high.
- Mater!
- Hey, McQueen! What happened?
Is the race over? You won, right?
Why were you yelling at me
while I was racing?
Yelling? Oh, you thought...
That's funny right there.
No, that's 'cause I seen
these two fellers doing
some karate street performance.
It was nutso.
One of 'em even had a flame-thrower.
A flame-thrower?
What are you talking about?
- I don't understand. Where were you?
- Going to meet my date.
Your date?
She started talkin' to me as a voice
in my head, tellin' me where to go.
- What?
- Wait a minute.
- I didn't screw ya up, did I?
- I lost the race because of you!
Oh. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.
An imaginary girlfriend?
Flame-throwers?
This is exactly why I don't bring you
along to these things.
Maybe if I, I don't know,
talk to somebody and explained
what happened, I could help.
I don't need your help!
I don't want your help!
Hey, there he is!
- McQueen, you had it in the bag!
- Yeah! What happened?
I made a mistake.
But I can assure you,
it won't happen again.
Look, we know what the problem is
and we've taken care of it.
Lightning McQueen loses
in the last lap to Francesco Bernoulli
in the first race of the World Grand Prix.
And three - count 'em -
three cars flamed out
leaving some to suggest that their fuel,
allinol, might be to blame.
Allinol is safe. Alternative fuel is safe.
There is no way my fuel
caused these cars to flame out.
The jury may still be out on whether
allinol caused these accidents,
but one thing's for sure,
Lightning McQueen blew this race.
Team McQueen
can't be happy right now.
Welcome to
Tokyo International Airport.
- Come with me, please, sir.
- But I'm 'onna miss my plane.
- Right this way.
- Ah, doggone it.
This is about my hook, ain't it?
I know I should have checked it,
but I can't, really.
Look. It's attached to me.
Hey, I know you. You're that feller
from the karate demonstration.
I never properly introduced myself.
Finn McMissile. British Intelligence.
Tow Mater. Average intelligence.
Who are you with? FBI? CIA?
Let's just say I'm AAA affiliated.
I know some karate.
I don't want to brag or nuttin',
but I got me a black fan belt.
- Wanna see some moves I made up?
- You're being followed.
This first one,
I can reach into a car's hood
pull out his battery,
and show it to him before he stalls.
I call it, "What I accidentally did
to my friend Luigi once."
Hey! Hi-yah-pah!
- Hi-yah!
- There he is!
Hi-hi-tah! Huh!
Look, I probably ought to go.
I'm about to miss my flight.
- Don't worry. I've taken care of that.
- Whoa!
Hang on!
Whoa-hah-hah!
This is first-class service.
You don't even have to go
through the terminal!
Your karate partners is back there.
They look like
they tryin' to catch up!
Drive forward.
Whatever you do, don't stop!
- Whoa!
- Whoa!
Whoa...
Is everything okay back there?
Finn, it's Sid. I'm on approach.
Roger that.
'Member that whole thing about me
not stoppin' no matter what?
I knew I shoulda done carry-on!
Thanks, old boy.
- You got it, mate.
Hey, doggonit!
Look, it's my imaginary girlfriend!
Come on! Get in here!
I tell you what, you really do
want this first date, don't ya?
That's a no-quit attitude right there.
What the?
- Aargh!
Hold on, Sid.
Aargh!
Come on, Finn! It's now or never!
Hold on!
By the time you read this, I will
be safely on an airplane flying home.
I'm so sorry for what I did.
McQUEEN: "I don't want to be
the cause of you losing any more races.
"I want you to go prove to the world
what I already know.
"That you are the greatest race car
in the whole wide world.
"Your best friend, Mater."
I didn't really want him to leave.
Wait, there's more here.
"PS. Please tell the hotel
"I didn't mean to order that movie.
"I thought it was just a preview
and I didn't realize I was paying for it.
"PPS. That's funny right there. PP."
There are a few more pages
of PS's here.
Well, at least I know
if he's at home, he'll be safe.
That's how I like to start the day.
You never feel more alive
than when you're almost dead.
Yeah.
I hope that device didn't fall off.
Whoa!
That's the closest I ever been
to missin' my flight.
That was... Oh!
- Still in one piece? Great.
I've got to go to a doctor.
I get these sharp pains
in my undercarriage.
- Downloading the photo now.
- Let me introduce you two.
This here is Finn McSomethin'
or other.
He's a first-class VIP
airport whatchamacallit.
And, Finn, this here is my date.
I never did get your name.
Oh, yes, sorry. It's Shiftwell.
Holley Shiftwell.
It's Shiftwell. Holley...
Finally.
Time to see who's behind all this.
What is this?
That's one of the worst engines
ever made.
It's an old aluminum V8 with a Lucas
electrical system and Whitworth bolts.
Shoot, them Whitworth bolts is a pain,
tell you what.
Them ain't metric, they ain't inches.
Yes, OK, but whose engine is this?
It's kinda hard to tell from this picture,
ain't it?
- But you took it.
- Holley.
Oh. Right! Yes, of course.
A good agent gets what he can,
then gets out before he's killed.
Agent? You mean, like,
insurance agent? Like...
Like a good neighbor,
Mater is there!
Wait! You mean secret agents!
You guys is spies!
In how many makes and models
did this type of engine appear?
It was standard in seven models
over a 12-year period.
At least 35,000 cars were made
with this engine.
- You're purty.
- Yes, thank you.
- And so nice.
- Just pay attention.
This seems like a dead end.
If there was something in the photo that
could narrow this down, I'd be happier.
You might not be happy,
but I bet this feller is.
See how he's had most of his parts
replaced?
And see all them boxes over there?
Them's all original parts.
They ain't easy to come by.
- Rare parts?
- That's something we can track.
Exactly.
Well done, Mater.
I would never have seen that.
I know of a black-market parts dealer
in Paris, a treacherous lowlife,
but he's the only car in the world
who can tell us whose engine this is.
What would you say to setting up
an informal task force on this one?
Wait. What?
You obviously have experience
in the field.
Yeah, I live right next to one.
I don't know.
I ain't exactly been much help
to anybody recently.
You're helping me.
Please, Mater.
Well... Okay.
But you know
I'm just a tow truck, right?
Right. And I'm just
in the import-export business.
- Siddeley?
- Yes, Finn?
Paris. Tout de suite.
Yeah, two of them sweets for me,
too, Sid.
I always wanted to be a spy.
Really? Me, too.
- Afterburners, sir?
- Is there any other way?
Ha ha ha!
Once we're inside, stay close.
Don't bother checking VIN numbers.
They're all dodgy here.
Got it.
Don't talk to anyone,
don't look at anyone,
and absolutely, positively no idling.
Are we clear?
Yes. No idling. Yes, sir.
- Mater?
- Yeah, Finn?
- We're not here to go shopping.
- Shoppin'? What do you mean?
Why would I...
Dad-gum.
- Part for sales, monsieur.
- Monsieur, part for sale.
They got everything here. No!
Look at them hoods!
I could use a hood.
Sorry, fellers. I gotta go!
Wow. Whoa. He-he!
Do what?
Excuse me. What are you selling?
Headlights, monsieur, headlights?
- What in the?
- Two for one.
- I give you good price!
- I'm good!
There you are.
- There is some great bargains here.
- Mater, get back!
- Imbcile!
Hey, wait for me!
Ahhhhhh!
Ag-g-g-h!
- Have you lost your mind?
- But I thought...
This chap needs a tow.
Hook him up.
Sure thing.
You rusty piece of junk!
Get your dirty hook off me!
Electroshock! Are you kidding me?
This is her first field assignment. She
didn't know you were my informant.
- Informant?
- A rookie, huh?
I never liked new car smell.
Tomber was doing 20-to-life
in a Moroccan impound
the first time I saved him,
if I recall correctly.
Speaking of recalls, you're getting up
there in mileage, aren't you?
All right, we get it. You both know
each other, you're both old.
So, here you go, informant.
Inform us.
Beuck!
That is the worst motor ever made.
Wait. That oil filter.
Those wheel bearings.
Do those parts look familiar, Tomber?
They should. I sold them.
To whom?
- No idea.
He's my best customer, but he always
does his business over the phone.
I was always wondering
why he needs so many parts.
Now I know.
A lemon needs parts.
Ain't nothin' truer than that.
- Lemon?
- Yeah. Cars that don't ever work right.
Lemons is a tow truck's
bread and butter.
Like 'em Gremlins and Pacers
we run into at the party
and the race and the airport.
Pull up the pictures
from the oil platform.
I want to know what other type of cars
were out there.
Right. Let's see.
There were Hugos and Trunkovs.
Are these cars considered lemons?
Is the Popemobile Catholic?
Everyone involved in this plot
is one of history's biggest loser cars.
And they're all taking their orders
from the car behind this engine.
- Ah. This explains it.
- What, Tomber?
Gremlin, Pacer, Hugo
and Trunkov never get together,
but they are having a secret meeting
in two days.
- Where's this meeting taking place?
- Porto Corsa, Italy.
That's where the next race is!
There's a good chance
our mystery engine will be there, too.
Your chances are more than good.
I just sent him a new clutch assembly
yesterday. To Porto Corsa.
Contact Stevenson
and have him meet us at Gare de Lyon.
Good work.
That three-wheeled feller
had to be right about a big meetin'.
You never see this many lemons
in one town.
'Less there's a swap meet.
How'd you get all them pictures?
I reprogrammed Porto Corsa's red light
cameras to do recognition scans.
Wow. Not only is you the purtiest car
I ever met, but you're the smartest, too.
Thank you... I think.
That's a familiar sight.
A Hugo being towed.
But he looks absolutely perfect!
Of course! They must be the heads
of the lemon families.
Makes sense. If I was rich
and broke down every day,
I'd hire me to tow me
around all the time, too!
We've got to infiltrate that meeting
to find out who's behind all this.
- Hang on a minute. Hold still.
- Ow!
Ah-ha. Good job, Miss Shiftwell.
Thank you, Finn.
Boy, I sure wish my friends
could see me now.
LUIGl: Guido,
your eyes do not deceive you.
We are in Italy. We are home.
Hey, Luigi.
Which way to the hotel, man?
What? No friend of mine
will stay in a hotel in-a my village.
You will stay with my...
Uncle Topolino-o-o-o!
Luigi! Guido!
How do they do it?
These are the same ingredients
as back home, but it tastes so good.
- It's organic, man.
- Treehugger.
Hey, race car.
You look so down, so low.
Is like you have flat tires.
She said you look like you are starving,
that she's gonna make you a big meal
and fatten you up.
Oh, no.
Mama Topolino, please,
you don't need to make a fuss.
Capisco. I understand.
Is a problem, yes,
between you and a friend?
How did you know that?
A wise car hears one word
and understands two.
That, and Luigi told me.
While Mama cooks,
come and take a stroll with me.
I brought my friend Mater along
on the trip
and I told him he needed
to act different,
that we weren't in Radiator Springs.
This Mater is a close friend?
He's my best friend.
Then why would you ask him to be
someone else?
What did I do?
I said some things during our fight.
You know, back when Guido and Luigi
used to work for me,
they would fight over everything.
They fight over what Ferrari
was the best Ferrari,
which one of them looked
more like a Ferrari.
There were even
some non-Ferrari fights.
So I tell them, "Va bene, it's OK to fight.
"Everybody fights now and then,
especially best friends.
"But you got to make up fast.
"No fight more important
than friendship."
- What does that mean?
- Whoever find a friend, find a treasure.
Now, mangia. Eat!
Finn, one hour to Porto Corsa.
Thank you, Stevenson.
- That should just about do it.
- Perfect.
So, Mater, it's voice-activated.
But everything's voice-activated
these days.
What? I thought you was supposed
to be makin' me a disguise.
Voice recognized.
Disguise program initiated.
Cool!
Computer, make me a German truck.
- Request acknowledged.
- Check it out! I'm wearing Materhosen.
Make me a monster truck!
- Request acknowledged.
- What the?
I vant to siphon your gas!
- Now make me a taco truck!
- Request acknowledged.
- A funny car!
- Request acknowledged.
The idea is to keep a low profile, Mater.
So I just go in, pretend to be this truck.
- And leave the rest to us.
- Now, hold still.
I have to do the final fitting
on your disguise.
That's no good. Hm.
Hey. What are you doin'?
The disguise won't calibrate effectively
without a smooth surface to graft onto.
For a second there, I thought
you was tryin' to fix my dents.
- Yes, I was.
- Then, no, thank you.
I don't get them dents buffed,
pulled, filled or painted by nobody.
- They way too valuable.
- Your dents are valuable? Really?
I come by each one of 'em with
my best friend, Lightning McQueen.
I don't fix these.
I wanna remember these dents forever.
So, you were being serious in Paris?
McQueen isn't just part of your cover.
Friendships can be dangerous
in our line of work, Mater.
But my line of work
is towin' and salvage.
Right. And Miss Shiftwell's
is designing iPhone apps.
- No, I meant for real.
- It's OK. I'll work around the dent.
- Oh...
- In the meantime...
...you look a little light on weapons.
You are looking live
at beautiful
Porto Corsa, Italy,
on the Italian Riviera.
What a magnificent setting for the
second race of the World Grand Prix!
Well Brent, they call this place
the "Gem of the Riviera,"
and it's easy to see why.
With its secluded beaches
and opulent casinos,
Porto Corsa truly is a playground
for the wealthy.
And everyone who's anyone
is here today,
from the ultra-rich and super-famous
to world leaders
and important dignitaries.
You aren't kidding, David.
You can't do a three-point turn
without bumping into some celebrity.
Welcome, everyone, to the second race
of the World Grand Prix,
where the big news
continues to be allinol.
Sir Miles Axlerod spoke to the press
earlier today
to answer questions about its safety.
An independent panel of scientists
has determined
that allinol is completely safe, okay?
Safe. There it is.
So the race will go on, folks.
But the question everyone is asking:
Will the real
Lightning McQueen show up today?
He'd better.
Talk about a home track advantage.
Francesco Bernoulli
grew up racing on this course.
Signore e signori, in the
pole position, Numero Uno, Francesco!
Bellissima!
Thank you for your support!
And your big mistake, McQueen!
In secondo position,
numero 95, Lightning-a McQueen-a!
McQueen-a, is-a everything OK?
If you're worried about your fuel, man,
don't. It's perfectly safe.
No, guys,
I just really wish Mater were here.
Francesco understands, McQueen.
Oh, great, here it comes.
What do you got, Francesco?
For famous race cars like Francesco
and, well, you,
to be far away from home is not easy.
I think you forgot
the insulting part of that insult.
Is-a no insult.
When-a Francesco is away from home,
he misses his mama,
just like-a you miss
your tow truck amico.
Gee, I maybe misjudged you,
because that's exactly...
Of course, I am at home,
and my mama is right here.
Mama!
Don't worry, Mama,
McQueen is very sad.
I will beat his cry-baby bottom today!
And there's the insult we were missing.
Darrell, the racers
are settling in as they head
to the Italian countryside.
Whoo, boy!
This is gonna be a great race.
Gremlins.
Man, those are some ugly cars.
Look like someone stole their trunks.
My grand-a father has-a broken down.
If-a one of-a you would help,
I would be so thankful.
Sounds like you need
some roadside assistance.
- She was talking to me.
- Really? Prove it.
Don't-a fight over me.
Signore Tow Truck, per favore.
Get ready, Mater.
You're on any moment now.
I don't know about this.
What if I screw things up?
Impossible.
Just apply the same level of dedication
you've been using to play
the idiot tow truck, and you'll be fine.
It's just that them guys look purty tough
and... Wait, did you say "idiot"?
- Is that how you see me?
That's how everyone sees you.
Isn't that the idea?
I tell you, that's the genius of it.
No one realizes they're being fooled
because they're too busy laughing
at the fool.
Brilliant!
- Why aren't you in disguise?
- I er...
- Come on! There's no time! Go!
- OK. OK.
- Computer, disguise!
Request acknowledged.
It's the boss. He's coming.
Ivan.
Oh, er...
Ivan, why do you insult me so
by making me wait here?
He's in.
The racers are now
making their way around the hairpin
and headed downhill
toward the casino bridge.
No more bets, please.
Come on, fuzzy dice!
- Number four. Easy four.
- Yeah!
Air freshener. Antenna balls.
Spark-a plugs.
This place looks like
it's made outta gold!
That's because it is.
Now, be careful what you say.
Why is that?
What do you mean, "Don't talk to ya"?
You want me to stop talkin' to ya
right now?
You are acting strange today, Ivan.
I have no idea
what you're talking about,
"Alexander Hugo, aka Chop Shop Alex."
You got a lot of aka's, Alex.
But that makes sense, seein's how
you's wanted in France, Germany...
Mater, stop it!
OK, OK, keep your voice down!
You gonna make me arrested!
Don't mess with Ivan today.
He's in a bad mood.
He's so good!
Victor!
Hey, Victor!
- There you are!
- Come in!
Victor Hugo, I'm J Curby Gremlin.
From Detroit.
It's good to see you.
Is the big boss here yet?
- No, not yet.
- He's supposed to be here any minute.
Here we go.
Guten Tag.
It's just the professor.
Zndapp! When is he coming?
He's already here.
Welcome, everyone.
I wish I could be with you
on this very special day,
but my clutch assembly broke.
- You know how it is.
- Forget about it.
We know how you feel.
- Descramble that voice.
- I'm trying.
Oh, it's too sophisticated.
We are here to celebrate.
Today, all your hard work pays off.
The world turned their backs
on cars like us.
They stopped manufacturing us,
stopped making our parts.
The only thing they haven't stopped
doing is laughing at us.
They've called us terrible names:
Jalopy, rust bucket, heap,
clunker, junker, beater,
wreck, rattletrap,
lemon.
But their insults just give us strength.
Because today, my friends,
that all ends!
There's smoke
on the casino bridge!
Oh, no!
It's Carla Veloso, the Brazilian race car!
- What just happened?
- I'm working on it.
They laughed at us,
but now it's our turn to laugh back.
Another crash!
It's number 9, Nigel Gearsley.
Embrace your inner lemon.
Let it drive you.
I'm detecting an extremely strong
electromagnetic pulse.
- Finn, it's the camera.
- Where?
On the tower!
This was meant to
be alternative fuel's greatest moment.
But after today,
everyone will race back to gasoline.
And we, the owners of the world's
largest untapped oil reserve
will become the most powerful cars
in the world!
Get out of the way!
They will come to us, and they will have
no choice, because they will need us.
Huh? Whoa!
We figured you might stop by!
And they will finally respect us!
So hold your hoods high!
After today, you will never again
be ashamed of who you are!
No!
Long live lemons!
Number 7 is loose!
Shu Todoroki!
Finn?
Bumper to bumper
as they approach the finish line!
McQueen's the winner!
Francesco's second!
They have no idea
what happened behind them.
This is impossible!
That's what I'm talking about! Ka-chow!
What happened?
- Where are all the other cars?
- What is going on?
Oh, no!
Sir Axlerod, is the final race in London
still going to take place?
I suppose that...
The show must go on,
as they say.
I can't believe this is really happening!
Quiet!
Will you require all the racers
to still run on allinol?
I cannot, in good conscience, continue
to risk the lives of any more race cars.
The final race will not be run on allinol.
There you have it, a clearly devastated
Sir Miles Axlerod
announcing that he will not require
the cars to use allinol for the final race.
A toast!
To the death of allinol
and alternative fuel forever!
Mater, abort the mission.
They've got Finn. Get out of there.
Get out of there right now.
How is your grandfather?
Long live lemons!
Isn't this a great party, Ivan, huh?
Oh, yeah, it's unbelievable.
You are not leaving, are you?
Uh... of course I ain't leaving.
- McQUEEN ON TV: I'm just in shock...
- McQueen?
Crashes are a part of racing, I know,
but something like that
should never happen.
You can choose your fuel
for the final race. What it'll be?
Allinol.
After today?
My friend Fillmore says it's safe.
That's good enough for me.
I didn't stand by a friend of mine
recently.
I'm not gonna make
the same mistake twice.
So a surprising revelation
from Lightning McQueen.
He will use allinol in the final race,
despite what occurred today.
...till Lightning McQueen is dead.
- Of course.
Allinol must be finished for good.
McQueen cannot win the last race.
Lightning McQueen must be killed!
No!
It's the American spy!
Dad-gum!
Gatling gun.
Request acknowledged.
Down! Everybody, down!
- Shoot! I didn't mean...
Request acknowledged.
Wait! Wait!
I didn't mean that kind of shoot!
Correction acknowledged.
Deploying chute.
Whoa!
McQueen!
Whoa! What's this?
Whoa!
McQueen! McQueen!
Waagh!
Let me through! Let me through!
Let me in!
I got to get through to warn McQueen!
You cannot-a come through here!
Back up.
We have a lunatic at gate 9.
I was disguised as a tow truck
to infiltrate this lemonhead meeting
and my weapons system's done
misinterperated what I'm saying!
- Lunatic at gate 9.
- McQueen! McQueen!
- You are the champion!
- This way, signore.
McQueen!
- Mater?
McQueen.
- Give us a pose!
- McQueen!
- Stop moving. Stop!
Where you going?
Stop!
- McQueen!
- That really sounded like...
Mater!
- Mater?
- Signore?
McQueen!
They're gonna kill you!
McQUEEN: Mater!
Excuse me.
No, where are you going?
Scusi. Mater!
- McQueen!
- Scusi.
Mater! Mater!
Mater, I'm so glad to see you.
Lightning McQueen!
I am a huge fan.
I'm sorry, I thought I heard...
That was me. I said, "You killed
out there today. You're the best."
- What? I mean, thanks.
- Right this way, signore.
I really thought I heard my friend.
In England, you'll be finished!
At the finish line.
- Wait, what?
- The press is waiting.
Come-a with me, please.
Let me go!
You actually care about that race car.
A pity you didn't warn him in time.
"Idiot"?
Is that how you see me?
That's how everyone sees you.
I tell you, that's the genius of it.
No one realizes they're being fooled
because they're too busy laughing
at the fool.
At the fool...
Excuse me!
Domo arigato!
Yeah!
You done good. You got all the leaves.
- Check out that tow truck.
- I wonder who that guy's with.
Will you guys excuse me
just for one little second?
Now that's a scoop of ice cream!
Aargh!
Somebody get me water!
Oh, sweet relief.
Mater!
But I never leak oil. Never.
Get a hold of yourself.
You're making a scene!
Wait a minute.
I didn't screw you up, did I?
- I lost the race because of you!
- Maybe if I talked to somebody...
I don't need your help!
I don't want your help.
Your help...
Bang the gong. Get it on!
McQUEEN: Listen,
this isn't Radiator Springs.
This is exactly why I don't bring
you along to these things!
Holley! Finn! Where are we?
We're in London, Mater,
inside Big Bentley.
Whoa!
Whoa!
Oh, this... This is all my fault.
Don't be a fool, Mater.
But I am, remember? You said so.
When did I... Oh.
Mater, I was complimenting you
on what a good spy you are.
I'm not a spy!
I've been trying to tell you that
the whole time.
I really am just a tow truck.
Finn, he's not joking.
- I know.
- You were right, Finn. I'm a fool.
And what's happened to McQueen
is 'cause I'm such a big one.
This is all my fault.
- Good. You're up.
- And just in time.
Professor Z wanted you
to have a front-row seat,
for the death of Lightning McQueen.
- He's still alive?
- Not for much longer.
Whoa!
Huh?
- We came as soon as you called.
- I called to talk to Mater.
It never occurred to me
he wouldn't be there.
Sheriff is talking to Scotland Yard now.
And Sarge is in touch with his friends
in the British military.
You just need
to focus on the race.
I know but, Sally with everything
going on, I'm not sure...
- Sir Axlerod.
- I'm sorry to interrupt.
- It's all right.
- I just wanted to personally thank you.
Because after Italy, I was finished,
and then you gave me one last shot.
Listen...
I probably shouldn't be saying this,
but I hope you win today.
You show the world
that they've been wrong about allinol.
Mater would want you to race.
All right. For Mater.
Here he comes.
What happened?
- I don't know, Professor.
- What did you do?
- I didn't do nothing.
Ssh, I'm talking to the Professor.
What's that, Professor?
- You broke it!
- Quiet!
- I understand, sir. Yes.
- What did he say?
- We go to the back-up plan.
- Back-up plan?
We snuck a bomb in McQueen's pit.
The next time he makes a stop,
instead of saying "ka-chow"...
he's going to go "ka-boom"!
Don't feel bad, tow truck.
You couldn't have saved him.
Oh, wait, you could have!
- Dad-gum lemons!
Request acknowledged.
What?
You didn't think we'd take your bullets?
That's right! You got nothing!
Who's the lemon now, huh?
Nice try, Mater.
- Dad-gum... Dad-gum... Dad-gum.
- Request... Request... Request...
Mater!
I got to get y'all out of there.
There's no time.
McQueen needs your help.
But I can't. I'm just a tow truck.
It's up to you.
Go to the pits and get everyone out.
- You can do that.
- What about you guys?
- We'll be OK.
- Go and get some more dents, Mater.
So, we'll be OK? Really?
He wouldn't have left
if I'd told him the truth.
Argh!
Being killed by a clock.
Gives a whole new meaning to
"Your time has come."
Time? That's it!
- What are you doing?
- Trying to turn back time.
If I can just reverse the polarity.
Good job. Quick thinking, Holley.
What's everybody
on the wrong side of the road for?
Oh, no!
Drive! Burn rubber!
We've got to get to the course.
Calculate the fastest way to...
Done.
Oh. Miss Shiftwell.
- They're standard issue now.
- You kids get all the good hardware.
Oh, no, that's Mater's.
I knew his escape was too easy.
Come back here! Stop!
- Mater?
- Everybody, get out now!
Y'all get out of the pits.
What are you guys doing here?
- We're here because of you, Mater.
- Is everything OK?
No, everything's not OK.
There's a bomb in here.
- Y'all got to get out. Now.
- A bomb?
Mater.
- Finn! You're OK.
Listen to me. The bomb is on you!
They knew you'd try to help McQueen.
When we were knocked out,
they planted it in your air filter.
- Uh-oh.
- Mater! There you are!
Stop right there!
- I've been so worried about you.
Don't come any closer!
McQUEEN: Are you OK?
No, I'm not OK! Stay away from me!
McQUEEN: No, wait! Wait!
A tow truck has just raced
onto the track, driving backwards!
Mater, wait!
Normally an emergency vehicle on the
track means there's been an accident.
- Lightning McQueen is chasing him!
- Mater, wait!
Stay back! If you get close to me,
you're going to get hurt real bad!
McQUEEN: I know I made you feel that
way before, but none of that matters!
We're best friends!
And McQueen
seems to be having
a conversation with the tow truck.
I don't know who
that truck is, Brent, but tell you what,
he's got to be the world's best
backwards driver.
McQueen, you don't get it!
I'm the bomb!
Yes, Mater! You are the bomb!
That's what I'm trying to say here!
You've always been the bomb
and you'll always be the bomb.
- Stay away!
- No! Never!
Almost there.
I'm not letting you get away again!
- Got to keep away from McQueen!
Request acknowledged.
Oh, my gosh.
What is happening? It's a bad dream!
And Lightning McQueen
just blasted away,
hooked to the now rocket-propelled
tow truck.
Gargh!
Aagh!
The Professor's on the run!
- Someone's got to get McQueen.
- Get McQueen!
- Holley, I'll get Zndapp. Help Mater.
- Got it!
What is happening?
Hurry, Professor.
You really think I'm going to let you
float away, Professor?
- McQueen, let go!
- Never!
- They're coming your way.
- Let's go!
Give it up, McMissile.
Mater, stop!
- No way! You could get hurt.
Oh, no.
Mater, we've got to get
that bomb off you.
Bomb?
Yeah, they strapped it to me
to kill you as a back-up plan.
Back-up plan?
Mater, who put a bomb on you?
You! Why didn't my death ray kill you?
Death ray?
Turn off the bomb, Zndapp!
Are you all so dense?
It's voice-activated.
Everything is voice-activated
these days.
Deactivate! Deactivate!
Voice denied.
- Huh!
- Oops.
Did I forget to mention
that it can only be disarmed
by the one who activated it?
- Say it.
- Deactivate.
Voice denied.
I'm not the one who activated it.
Would anyone else like to try?
- You read my mind.
- He was getting on my nerves.
- What do we do?
- It's very simple. You blow up.
I'm going out on a limb here. These are
the guys that want me dead, correct?
- It's nothing personal.
- Fellers, listen.
I know what you're going through.
Everybody's been laughing at me too.
But becoming powerful and rich
beyond your wildest dreams
ain't gonna make you feel better.
Yeah, but it's worth a shot.
Pit stop.
Not today, boys.
Retreat!
Thanks for the help, Corporal.
Anything for one of Pop's mates.
What's he saying? What's wrong?
None of his wrenches fit the bolts.
I get it. I get it!
- I know what needs to be done.
- Then do it!
What? No. I can't do it.
Nobody takes me seriously.
I know that now.
This ain't Radiator Springs.
Yes, it is.
Look, you're yourself
in Radiator Springs.
Be yourself here.
And if people aren't taking you
seriously,
then they need to change, not you.
I know that
because I was wrong before.
Now, you can do this. You're the bomb.
Thanks, buddy.
No, you're the actual bomb.
Now, let's go!
Oh, right. Hang on!
Where's he going?
- Computer!
Yes, Agent Mater?
I need that thing you done before
to get me away from McQueen!
Request acknowledged.
- Mater?
- Now I need you to do the chute!
The second kind, not the first!
Deploying chute.
Who's winning the race?
- Back off! Back away!
- It's Lightning McQueen!
No, it's OK! Tell 'em, Mater. Explain.
Okay.
Somebody's been sabotaging
the racers and hurtin' the cars,
and I know who.
Oh, wait. Your Majesty.
Bomb! It's a bomb!
- Everybody, down!
- Back up! Move it!
Get off the stage! Move it!
Hold your fire! He can't disarm it!
Mater, I don't know what you're doing,
but stand down now.
This ain't nothing at all
like Radiator Springs.
Mater, just cut to the chase.
Okay. It's him.
What? Me? You've got to be crazy.
I figured it out when I realized
y'all attached this ticking time bomb
with Whitworth bolts...
the same bolts that hold together that
old British engine from the photograph.
- Holley! Show that picture.
- OK.
I remembered what they say
about old British engines:
If there ain't no oil under 'em,
there ain't no oil in 'em.
What is he talking about?
It was you leaking oil
at the party in Japan.
You just blamed it on me.
Electric cars don't use oil, you twit.
Then you're fakin' it.
You didn't convert to no electric.
If we pop that hood,
we'll see that engine from that picture.
This lorry's crazy!
He's going to kill us all!
Stay away!
But Sir Axlerod created the race.
Why would he want to hurt anyone?
To make allinol look bad so
everybody'd go back to using oil.
He said it himself
with that disguised voice.
Disguised voice? What are you
talking about? You're nuts, you are!
This is going nowhere fast.
We really should go, Grandmother.
One moment, I'd like to see
where this is going.
Mater, he created allinol.
But what if he found that huge oil field
just as the world was trying to find
something else?
What if he came up with allinol
just to make alternative fuel look bad?
"What if?"
You're basing this on a "what if"?
- Okay, that's it.
- Lads, clear out.
Wait! Somebody save me!
The lorry's crazy!
- Keep away, you idiot!
- Mater!
- Mater!
- Someone do something!
You're insane, you are! Deactivate!
Bomb deactivated.
Have a nice day, Sir Axlerod.
- The engine from the photo.
- It's a perfect match.
How did the tow truck figure it out?
It's official. You're coming to
all my races from now on.
Now you're talkin'!
Hyeeugh!
Mater, let's go. You're on.
Your Majesty, may I present
for the investiture of honorary
knighthood of the British Realm...
Tow Mater of Radiator Springs.
Go get 'em, buddy.
I hereby dub thee Sir Tow Mater.
Sir? Shoot, you can just call me Mater,
Your Majesty.
I don't wanna hear none of this "sir"
business.
By the way, have y'all met each other?
Queen, McQueen. McQueen, Queen.
McQueen, McMissile. McMissile,
McQueen. Queen, McMissile.
So there we was,
my rocket jets going full blast,
McQueen hanging on for dear life
when suddenly them two nasty lemons
come out of nowheres, guns drawed.
We was goners.
But then, out of nowhere
this beautiful spy car
swoops in from the sky to save us!
That's a very entertaining story,
young man.
Oh, Minny, please. Come on!
None of this happened.
Rocket jets, flying spy cars.
No, you're quite right.
It does sound a bit far-fetched.
Holley! What are you doin' here?
Hello, Mater!
It's so good to see you again.
Finn!
Our satellites picked up
an urgent communiqu.
So you got-a my email.
Y'all is going to have a great time!
Everybody, this here's Finn McMissile.
He's a secret agent.
Don't tell nobody.
And this is Holley Shiftwell.
- She's...
- I'm Mater's girlfriend.
It's so nice to meet you all.
Guido believe you now.
Whoa, honey.
You got a nasty dent there.
- Yeah.
- Was that from when you swooped in
and you saved them in London?
- Van!
- What? I'm just asking!
Don't you worry. My baby Ramone
can get that fixed up for you in no time.
Yeah, sure thing.
No problemo. Let me go get my tools.
Oh, no. I'm keeping that dent.
It's way too valuable.
A valuable dent?
She's as crazy as Mater.
Those two are perfect for each other.
There's one thing I still don't get.
The bad guys hit me with the beam
from the camera, right?
- So, why didn't I...
- Explode in a fiery inferno?
- Yeah.
- We couldn't figure that out, either.
Our investigation proved
that allinol was actually gasoline
and Axlerod engineered it so when it
got hit by the beam, it would explode.
Wait a second, Fillmore.
You said my fuel was safe!
If you're implying that I switched
that rot-gut excuse for alternative fuel
with my all-natural, sustainable,
organic biofuel
just because I never trusted Axlerod,
you're dead wrong, man!
It was him!
Once big oil, always big oil, man.
Tree-hugger.
The Radiator Springs Grand Prix
is about to begin.
All spectators, clear the starting line.
I can't wait to get rockin'.
This is gonna be wicked!
We should do this every year.
Yeah, I just figured we never found out
who the world's fastest car is.
Plus, no press, no trophy, just racing.
- The way I like it.
- Francesco likes it like this, too.
- Francesco, I'd like you to meet...
- Signorina Sally.
It is official.
Lightning McQueen
is the luckiest car in the world.
Why, thank you.
Which he will have to be to have
a chance against Francesco today!
See you at the finish line, Mc...
What is that?
Just something I had made up
for the occasion.
Is-a good, McQueen. Very funny.
Was-a funnier when I did it,
but it's-a very funny.
What are you going to do next?
Are you going to take off your fenders?
Try it. You'll like it.
So, he's not so good-looking.
- Yeah. Nice try.
- I'm serious!
That's why I love you, Sally.
- Wish me luck!
- You don't need it!
Ooh-hm!
That Francesco is fine-looking!
And those open wheels.
Ooh, I'm gonna have to go get myself
some coolant.
Go, Lightning!
- Go, Stickers!
- Right on, man!
- Go get 'em, tiger!
- Bravo, bravo!
- Go, Lightning, go!
- Go, McQueen! Whoo-hoo!
Finn? Time to go.
Siddeley's gassed, geared
and ready to fly.
- You're leavin' already?
- We've got another mission.
Just stopped by here
to pick something up.
Somethin' tells me you're not
talkin' about souvenir bumper stickers.
Her Majesty asked for you personally,
Mater.
- But I told y'all before, I'm not a spy.
- We know.
Spy or not, you're still the smartest,
most honest chap we've ever met.
- Don't forget massively charming.
- Well, thanks.
But as much fun as it was
hangin' with y'all, this...
This is home.
That's all right. We understand.
But I'll be back.
You still owe me that first date.
If there's ever anything I can do for you,
just let me know.
Well, I sure appreciate that. Thank you.
Actually, there is one thing.
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo! I'll be doggone!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Thanks, Mater!
Ha-ha-ha! Whoo!
Impossible!
- Ha-ha!
- Mater!
Check it out.
They let me keep the rockets.
I'll see you at the finish line, buddy!
Not if I see you first!
Yippee!


Sometimes, I think I'm cursed.
'Cause of something that happened
before I was even born.
See, a long time ago,
there was this family.
The Pap, he was a musician.
He and his family
would sing and dance
and count their blessings.
But he also had a dream.
To play for the world.
And one day...
he left with his guitar...
and never returned.
And my Mam...
She didn't have time to cry
over that walk-away musician.
After banishing all music
from her life...
she found a way
to provide for her daughter.
She rolled up her sleeves...
and she learned to make shoes.
She could have made candy.
O-o-or fireworks.
Or sparkly underwear for wrestlers.
But no.
She chose shoes.
Then she taught
her daughter to make shoes.
And later, she taught
her son-in-law.
Then her grandkids got roped in.
As her family grew,
so did the business.
Music have torn
her family apart.
But shoes held
them all together.
You see that woman...
was my great-great-grandmother...
Mam Imelda.
She died way before I was born.
But my family still
tells her story...
every year on Da de los Muertos
-- the Day of the Dead...
And her little girl?
She's my great-grandmother, Mam Coco.
Hola, Mam Coco.
How are you, Julio?
Actually, my name is Miguel.
Mam Coco has trouble
remembering things.
But it's good to talk to her,
anyway.
So, I tell her
pretty much everything.
I used to run like this.
But now I run like this,
it's just way faster.
The winner is...
luchadora Coco!
I have a dimple on this side,
but not on this side.
Dimple, no dimple.
Dimple, no dimple.
Miguel, eat your food.
My abuelita, she's
Mam Coco's daughter.
Aw, you're a twig, mijo.
Have some more.
No, gracias.
I asked if you would like
more tamales.
S-Si?
That's what I thought you said!
Abuelita runs the house
just as Mam Imelda did.
No music!
No music!
Aunque la vida...
No music!
I think we're the only family
in Mexico who hates music.
And my family's fine with that.
But me...
Be back by lunch, mijo.
Love you, Mam!
I'm not like the rest
of my family.
- Hola, Miguel.
- Hola.
- Muchas gracias!
- De nada, Miguel!
He-hey, Dante!
Sit.
Down.
Roll over.
Shake.
Fist bump.
Good boy, Dante!
I know, I'm not supposed
to love music.
But it's not my fault.
It's his.
Ernesto de la Cruz.
The greatest musician
of all time.
Here in this very plaza,
the young Ernesto de la Cruz
took his first steps
toward becoming
the most beloved singer
in Mexican history.
He started out a total nobody
from Santa Cecilia, like me.
But when he played music,
he made people
fall in love with him.
He starred in movies.
He had the coolest guitar.
He could fly!
And he wrote the best songs.
But my all-time favorite is...
Remember me
Though I have to say goodbye
Remember me
Don't let it make you cry
For even if I'm far away
I hold you in my heart
I sing a secret song to you
Each night we are apart
Remember me
Though I have to travel far
Remember me
Each time you hear a sad guitar
Know that I'm with you the only way that I can be...
Until you're in my arms again
He lived the kind of life you dream about...
Remember me
Until 1942.
When he was crushed
by a giant bell.
I wanna be just like him.
Sometimes, I look at de la Cruz...
and I get this feeling.
Like we're connected somehow.
Like if he could play music...
maybe someday, I could too!
If it wasn't for my family.
Ay, ay, ay, muchacho!
Huh?
I asked for a shoe shine,
not your life story.
Oh, yeah, sorry.
I just can't really talk about
any of this at home, so.
Look, if I were you,
I'd march right up
to my family and say,
"Hey, I'm a musician.
Deal with it!"
I could never say that.
You are a musician, no?
I could never say that.
You are a musician, no?
I-I-I don't know.
I mean, I only really
play for myself.
Ah! Did de la Cruz become
the world's best musician
by hiding his sweet,
sweet skills?
No!
He walked out onto that plaza
and he played out loud!
Mira, Mira, they're
setting up for tonight.
The music competition for
Da de Muertos.
You wanna be like your hero?
You should sign up!
Unh-unh. My family would freak!
Look, if you're too scared,
then, well, have fun making shoes.
Come on, what did
de la Cruz always say?
Seize your moment?
Show me what you got,
muchacho.
I'll be your first audience.
Miguel!
Ah!
Abuelita!
What are you doing here?
Um... oh... uh...
You leave my grandson alone!
Doa, please! I was just
getting a shine.
I know your tricks, mariachi.
What did he say to you?
He was just showing me
his guitar.
Shame on you!
My grandson is a
is a sweet little
angelito, perrito, cielito!
He wants no part
of your music, mariachi.
You keep away from him.
Ay, pobrecito!
Estas bien, mijo.
You know better than
to be here in this place.
You will come home.
Now.
How many times
have we told you?
That plaza is crawling
with mariachis.
Yes, To Berto.
No, no, no, no, no.
Hey, go away, you. Go!
It's just Dante.
Never name a street dog.
They'll follow you forever.
Now, go get my shoe.
I found your son in
Mariachi Plaza.
Ay, Miguel?
You know how abuelita
feels about the plaza.
I was just shining shoes.
A musician's shoes.
But the plaza's where
the foot traffic is.
If abuelita says, "No more plaza",
then no more plaza.
But what about tonight?
What's tonight?
Well, they're having
this talent show.
- A-and I thought I might...
- Sign up?
Well, maybe?
You have to have talent
to be in a talent show.
What are you gonna do?
Shine shoes? Oh!
It's Da de los Muertos.
No one's going any where.
Tonight is about family.
Ofrenda room. Vmonos.
Don't give me that look.
Da de los Muertos is the
one night of the year
our ancestors can come visit us.
We put their photos
on the ofrenda
so their spririts can cross over.
That is very important.
If we don't put them up,
they can't come.
We made all this food.
Set out the things
they loved in life, mijo.
All this work to
bring the family together.
I don't want you sneaking off
to who-knows-where.
Huh! Where are you going?
- I thought we were done.
- Ay, Dios mo.
Being part of this family means
being here for this family.
I don't want to see you
end up like...
Like Mam Coco's pap?
Never mention that man!
He's better off forgotten.
- But you're the one who...
- Eh, thchhsss!
- I was just...
- Tchsshh!
- But...
- Tchshh.
- I...
- Shhh.
Pap?
Pap is home?
Mam, clmese, clmese.
Pap is coming home?
No, Mam, it's okay.
I'm here.
Who are you?
Ay... rest, Mam.
I'm hard on you
because I care, Miguel.
Miguel?
Miguel?
Ay.
What are we going to do
with that boy?
Ha ha ha, you're right.
That's just what he needs.
Huah!
Oh, it's you. Get in here.
Come on, Dante. Hurry up.
You're gonna get me
in trouble, boy.
Someone can hear me.
I wish someone
wanted to hear me.
Other than you.
Ew, okay!
Perfecto.
I have to sing.
I have to play.
The music, it's...
it's not just in me.
It is me.
When life gets me down.
I play my guitar.
The rest of the world may
follow the rules, but I...
must follow my heart.
Ugh.
You know that feeling...
like there's a song in the air
and it's playing just for you?
A feeling so close
You could reach out
and touch it
I never knew
I could want something
so much
But it's true
You must have faith, sister.
Oh, but Padre,
he will never listen.
He will listen to music!
Only a song, only a song
Has the power
to change a heart
Never underestimate
the power of music.
But my father,
he will never give
his permission.
I am done
asking permission.
When you see your moment,
you mustn't let it pass you by.
You must seize it.
Seor de la Cruz,
what did it take for you
to seize your moment?
I had to have faith
in my dream.
No one was going to hand it to me.
It was up to me to
reach for that dream.
Grab it tight...
and make it come true.
No more hiding, Dante.
I gotta seize my moment.
I'm gonna play in Mariachi Plaza
if it kills me.
Da de Muertos has begun!
No, no, no, no, no.
We have to make a clear path.
The petals guide
our ancestors home.
- Mam!
- Hunh!
Where should we put this table?
In the courtyard, mijos.
You want it down
by the kitchen?
Si, eh, next to the other one.
Get under, get under!
Miguel?
Uh, nothing.
Mam, Pap, I...
Miguel, your abuelita have
the most wonderful idea.
We've all decided...
it's time you joined us
in the workshop!
What?
No more shining shoes.
You will be making them,
every day, after school.
Oh, our Miguelitititito
carrying on the family tradition.
And on Da de los Muertos!
Your ancestors
would be so proud.
You'll craft huaraches
just like your Ta Victoria.
And wing tips just like
your Pap Julio.
But what if I'm no good
at making shoes?
Ay, Miguel.
You have your family here
to guide you.
You are a Rivera.
And a Rivera is?
A shoemaker...
through and through.
That's my boy!
Haha! Berto!
Break out the good stuff!
Mm, mm, mm, mwah!
Dante!
No, Dante, stop!
Hunh!
Ah!
No, no, no, no, no!
No.
De la Cruz' guitar?
Ah?
Pap?
Mam Coco.
Is your pap Ernesto de la Cruz?
Pap! Pap!
Haha!
Pap, Pap!
It's him!
I know who my
great-great-grandfather was!
Miguel, get down from there.
Mam Coco's father
was Ernesto de la Cruz!
What are you talking about?
I'm gonna be a musician!
What is all this?
You keep secrets
from your own family?
It's all that time he spends
in the plaza.
Fills his head
with crazy fantasies.
It's not a fantasy.
That man was
Ernesto de la Cruz.
The greatest musician
of all time.
We've never known
anything about this man.
Or whoever he was,
he still abandoned his family.
It's no future for my son.
Well, Pap, y-you said
my family would guide me.
Well, de la Cruz is my family.
I'm supposed to play music.
Never! That man's music
was a curse.
I will not allow it.
- If you would just...
- Miguel.
You will listen to your family.
No more music.
Just listen to me play.
End of argument.
You want to end up
like that man?
Forgotten?
Left off your family's ofrenda?
I don't care if I'm on some
stupid ofrenda.
- Hunh!
- Hunh!
- No!
- Mam!
There.
No guitar.
No music.
Aw, come.
You'll feel better after
you eat with your family.
I don't wanna be in this family!
Miguel, Miguel!
I-I wanna play in the plaza.
Like de la Cruz.
C-can I still sign up?
You got an instrument?
No. But if I can borrow a guitar.
Musicians gotta bring
their own instruments.
You find a guitar, kid,
I'll put you on the list.
Hey, excuse me,
can I borrow your guitar?
Sorry, muchaco.
You guys have a spare guitar?
No.
I need a guitar
just for a little bit.
Get outta here, kid.
Great-great-grandfather.
What am I supposed to do?
No, no, no, no.
Dante, stop.
Cllate, shh.
I'm sorry.
Seor de la Cruz.
Please don't be mad.
I-I'm Miguel.
Your great-great-grandson.
I-I need to borrow this.
Our family thinks
music is a curse.
None of them understand.
But I know you would have.
You would have told me
to follow my heart.
To seize my moment.
So, if it's all right with you...
I'm gonna play in the Plaza.
Just like you did!
Huh?
What's going on?
Somebody stole
de la Cruz' guitar.
The window is broken, look!
All right, who's in there?
I'm sorry, i-it's not
what it looks like.
De la Cruz is my...
Huh!
There's nobody here!
- Miguel!
- Mam!
Miguel, come home!
Dios mio, little boy!
Are you okay?
Here, let me help you.
Thanks. I...
- Aaah!
- Aaah!
Aah!
Aah!
Do you mind?
- Aah!
- Aah!
Look how big she's getting.
Uh! Dante?
You can see me?
Wait! What's going on?
Dante! Dante!
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Miguel?
- Miguel?
- Miguel?
Y-you're here!
Here here.
And you can see us?
Our Miguelitititito!
Remind me how I know you?
We're your family, mijo.
Ta Rosita?
Si.
Pap Julio?
Hola!
Ta Vic...toria?
He doesn't seem
entirely dead.
He's not quite alive, either.
We need Mam Imelda.
She'll know how to fix this.
Oye!
It's Mam Imelda!
She couldn't cross over!
She's stuck!
On the other side!
To Oscar?
To Felipe?
Oh, hey, Miguel.
I have a feeling this has
something to do with you.
But if Mam Imelda
can't come to us...
Then we are going to her!
- Whoa!
- Vmonos!
Whoa.
Come on, Miguel, it's-it's okay.
Dante?
Dante!
Dante, wait up!
You've gotta stay with me, boy.
You don't know...
where...
This isn't a dream, then.
You're all really out there.
You thought we weren't?
Oh, I don't know.
I thought it might have been
one of those made-up things...
that adults tell kids, like...
vitamins.
Miguel, vitamins
are a real thing.
Well, now I'm thinking
maybe they could be.
Hunh!
Mija, it's not nice to stare at...
Ay, Santa Ma...
Are those?
Alebrijes!
- But those are...
- Real alebrijes.
Spirit creatures.
They guide souls
on their journey.
Watch your step,
they make cacitas everywhere.
Welcome back
to the Land of the Dead.
Please have all offerings
ready for re-entry.
Welcome back.
Anything to declare?
Some churros, from my family.
How wonderful!
If you're experiencing
travel issues...
Agents at the Department of
Family Reunion
are available to assist you.
Next family, please.
Oh, your photos are
in your son's ofrenda.
Have a great visit.
- Gracias.
- Gracias.
And remember to return
before sunrise.
Enjoy your visit!
Next?
Your photo's on your
dentist's ofrenda.
Enjoy your visit.
Grashiash.
Next?
Yes, it is I, Frida Kahlo.
Shall we skip the scanner?
I'm on so many ofrendas
it will just overwhelm your
blinky thingy.
Whoa, shoot.
Looks like no one
put up your photo...
Frida?
Okay, when I said
I was Frida, just now...
That.
That was a lie.
And I apologize for doing that.
No photo on an ofrenda,
no crossing the bridge.
You know what?
I'm just gonna zip right over.
You won't even know I'm gone.
Haha!
Almost... there...
Just a little... further...
Ugh.
Upsy daisy.
Fine. Okay. Fine, who cares?
Dumb flower bridge!
Aw, I don't know what I'd do
if no one put up my photo.
Next?
Oh, come mijo, it's our turn.
Welcome back, amigo.
Anything to declare?
A-as a matter of fact...
Yes.
Hola.
Paging Marta Gonzalez Ramos...
Marta Gonzalez Ramos...
Please report to level seven.
Whoa.
I miss my nose.
Come on, help us out, amigo.
We gotta get to a
dozen ofrendas tonight.
We are not visiting
your ex-wife, Stanley,
por Da de Muertos.
I demand to speak to the
person in charge.
I'm sorry, seora, it says here
no one put up your photo.
My family always, always
put my photo up in the ofrenda
That devil box tells you
nothing but lies.
Mam Imelda?
Oh, mi familia.
They wouldn't let me
cross the bridge.
Tell this woman and her
devil box
that my photo is in the ofrenda.
Well, w-we never
made it to the ofrenda.
What?
We ran into a...
um...
Hunh! Miguel?
Mam Imelda.
What is going on?
You the Rivera family?
Well, you're cursed.
What?
Da de los Muertos
is a night to give to the dead.
You stole from the dead.
But I wasn't sealing the guitar.
Guitar?
It was my
great-great-grandfather's.
He would have
wanted me to have it.
Ah-ah-ah! We do not speak
of that musician.
He is dead to this family.
Uh, you're all dead.
Achoo!
I am sorry, uh,
who's alebrije is that?
That's Dante.
He sure doesn't look
like an alebrije.
He just looks like
a plain old dog.
Or a sausage someone
dropped in a barbershop.
Whatever he is, I am-
achoo!
terribly allergic.
But Dante doesn't have any hair.
And I don't have a nose
and yet here we are.
Achoo!
But none of this explains
why I couldn't cross over.
Oh...
You took my photo
off the ofrenda?
It was an accident.
How do we send him back?
Well, since it's a family matter...
The way to undo a family curse is
to get your family's blessing.
That's it?
Get your family's blessing
and everything should
go back to normal.
But you've gotta do it by sunrise.
What happens at sunrise?
Hjole, your hand!
Huh!
Whoa, Miguel.
Can't have you fainting on us.
But not to worry.
Your family is here.
You can get your
blessing right now.
Cempasuchil, cempasuchil.
Aha!
Perdn, seora.
Oh.
Now, you look at the living
and say his name.
Miguel.
Nailed it.
Now say,
"I give you my blessing."
I give you my blessing.
I give you my blessing
to go home...
To put my photo back
on the ofrenda...
And to never play music again.
What? She can't do that!
Well, technically, she can add
any condition she wants.
Fine.
Then you
hand the petal to Miguel.
Ha!
No skeletons.
Mariachi Plaza, here I come.
Two seconds and you
already break your promise.
This isn't fair, it's my life.
You already had yours.
Pap Julio,
I ask for your blessing.
Ta Rosita?
Oscar?
Felipe?
Ta Victoria?
Don't make this hard, mijo.
You go home my way,
or no way.
You really hate music
that much?
I will not let you go down
the same path he did.
The same path he did.
He's family.
Listen to your Mam Imelda.
She's just looking out for you.
Be reasonable.
Con permiso,
I need to visit the rest room.
Be right back.
Ah, should we tell him
there are no restrooms
in the Land of the Dead?
Vmonos.
We got a family looking
for a living boy.
I wanna be a musician,
I need a musician's blessing.
We gotta find my
great-great-grandpa.
Hold it, muchaco.
Huh!
I found that little boy!
Oh, excuse me.
Excuse me, folks.
Excuse me.
Oh.
Dante.
Disturbing the peace.
Fleeing an officer.
Falsifying a unibrow.
That's illegal?
Very illegal.
You need to clean up
your act, amigo.
Amigo?
Oh, that's-that's so nice
to hear you say that because
I have just had a really
hard Da de Muertos
and I could really use
an amigo right now.
And amigos, they help
their amigos.
Listen, you get me across
that bridge tonight...
and I'll make it
worth your while.
You like de la Cruz?
He and I go way back.
I can get you front row seats
to his sunrise spectacular show.
I-I'll get you backstage.
You can meet him.
You just gotta let me
cross that bridge.
I should lock you up
for the rest of the holiday.
But my shift's almost up and...
I wanna visit my living family.
So I'm letting you off
with a warning.
Can I at least
get my costume back?
Uh... no.
Ser maldito.
Hey.
Hey!
You really know de la Cruz?
Who wants to... ah! Ay!
You're alive!
Yeah, I'm alive.
And I want to get back to
the Land of the Living...
I need de la Cruz' blessing.
That's weirdly specific.
He's my great-great-grandfather.
He's your gr-gr-gr-
what?
Ew.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait.
Hunh!
Wait. No. Wait, wait, wait, wait
Wait, uh, wait,
Wait, uh, wait, wait,
Wait, uh, wait, wait, wait,
Wait, uh, wait, wait, wait, wait,
Wait, uh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
Wait, uh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Yes! You're going back
to the Land of the Living!
You know what? Maybe this
isn't such a good...
Nio, nio, I can help you.
You can help me.
We can help each other.
But most importantly,
you can help me.
- Miguel!
- Huh!
- I'm Hctor.
- That's nice.
Esperame, chamaco!
Ay! He is going
to get himself killed!
I need my spirit guide...
Pepita.
Who has that petal
Miguel touched?
Here... n-nice alebrije.
Hey, hey, hold still.
Look up, look up.
A ver, a ver.
Look up, up, up!
Okay.
Eh. Ta-da!
Dead as a doorknob.
So listen, Miguel.
This place runs on memories.
When you're well remembered,
people put up your photo...
and you get to cross the bridge
and visit the living on
Da de Muertos.
Unless you're me.
You don't get to cross over?
No one's ever put up my picture.
But you can change that!
This is you?
Eh, Muy guapo, eh?
So, you get me to my
great-great-grandpa...
Then I put up your photo
when I get home?
Such a smart boy!
Yes! Great idea, yes!
One hiccup, de la Cruz
is a tough guy to get to...
and I need to cross that
bridge soon. Like tonight.
So, you got any other
family here, you know?
Someone a bit more, eh,
accessible?
Um... nope.
Don't yank my chain, chamaco.
You gotta have
some other family.
Only de la Cruz.
If you can't help me,
I'll find him myself.
Ugh. Okay, okay, kid.
Fine, fine.
I'll get you to your
great-great-grandpa.
It's not gonna be easy,
you know.
You know, he's a-
he's a busy man.
Wait, what are you doing?
I'm walking like a skeleton.
Blending in.
No. Skeletons don't
walk like that.
It's how you walk.
No, I don't.
Stop it!
Whoa!
Ernesto de la Cruz'
Sunrise Spectacular?
Que padre?
Wuacch, every year,
your great-great-grandpa
puts on that dumb show
to mark the end of Da de Muertos.
A-a-and you can get us in!
I'm...
Hey, you said you had
front-row tickets!
That...
that was a lie.
I apologize for that.
Cool off, chamaco, come on.
I'll get you to him.
How?
'Cause I happen to know
where he's rehearsing.
Ugh.
You better have
my dress, Hctor.
Hola, Ceci!
Ay!
Hola.
Cezi!
I lost the dress.
Ay, diosa Mia!
I've got to dress 40 dancers
by sunrise.
- And thanks to you...
- Cezi, Cezi...
- I'm one Frida short
- Cezi...
of an opening number.
- Dante.
Dante!
We shouldn't be in here.
Dante! Ven ac!
You!
How did you get in here?
I-I just followed my...
Hunh! Oh, the mighty Xolo dog!
Guider of wandering spirits.
And whose spirit
have you guided to me?
I don't think he's a spirit guide.
Uh-uh-uh! The alebrijes of this
world can take many forms.
They are as mysterious
as they are powerful.
Or maybe he's just a dog.
Come! I need your eyes.
Your are the audience.
Darkness!
And from the darkness...
A giant papaya!
Dancers emerge from the papaya.
And the dancers...
Are all me!
And they go to drink
from the milk of their mother.
Who is a cactus.
But who is also me!
And her milk is not milk...
but tears.
Is it too obvious?
I think it's just the
right amount of obvious.
It could use some music.
Oh, what if you did like...
Tun-tun-tun-tun-tun?
Oh, and then it could go...
Darala-dalala-dalala-dalala
Whenk?
And what if everything was on fire?
Yes! Fire everywhere!
Inspired.
You. You have
the spirit of an artist.
The dancers exit. The music fades.
The lights go out.
And Ernesto de la Cruz
rises to the stage.
Huh?
He does a couple of songs.
The sun rises. Everyone cheers.
Excuse me, where's
the real de la Cruz?
Ernesto doesn't do rehearsals.
He's too busy hosting that
fancy party at the top of his tower.
Chamaco, you can't
run off on me like that.
Come on, stop pestering
the celebrities.
You said my great-great-grandpa
would be here.
He's halfway across town
throwing some big party.
That bum. Who doesn't show up
to his own rehearsal?
If you're such good friends,
how come he didn't invite you?
He's your great-great-grandpa.
How come he didn't invite you?
Hey, Gustavo! You know
anything about this party?
Sh-it's the hot ticket!
But if you're not on the guest list,
you're never gettin' in,
Chorizo.
Hey, it's Chorizo!
Ah-ha, very funny, guys.
Very funny.
Chorizo?
Oh, this guy's famous.
Go on, go on.
Ask him how he died.
I-I don't wanna talk about it.
He choked on some chorizo!
I didn't choke, okay?
I got food poisoning
which is a big difference.
This is why I don't like musicians.
Bunch of self-important jerks!
Hey, I'm a musician.
- You are?
- Well...
If you really wanna get to Ernesto...
there is that music competition
at the Plaza de la Cruz.
Winner gets to play at his party.
No, no, no, Chamaco!
You are loco if you think...
I need to get my great-great-
grandfather's blessing.
You know where
I can get a guitar?
Ay... I know a guy.
Have you found him, Pepita?
Have you found our boy?
A footprint!
It's a Rivera boot.
- Size seven!
- And a half.
- Pronated.
- Miguel.
Why the heck would you
wanna be a musician?
My great-great-grandfather's
a musician.
Who spent his life performing like
a monkey for complete strangers?
Blech! No, no, thank you, no.
What do you know?
So, how far is this guitar, anyway?
We're almost there.
Keep up, chamaco, come on!
Cousin Hctor!
Hey! These guys!
Hctor!
Hey, to, qu onda?
These people are all you family?
Eh... yeah, in a way.
We're all the ones with
no photos or ofrendas.
No family to go home to.
Nearly forgotten, you know?
So we all call each other
"cousin" or "to" or-or whatever.
- Hctor!
- Ta Chelos! Hey!
Muchas gracias.
Save some for me.
Is Chicharrn around?
In the bungalow. I don't know if
he's in the mood for visitors.
Ah, who doesn't like a
visit from cousin Hctor?
Huh!
Buenas noches, Chicharrn.
I don't want to see your
stupid face, Hctor.
Come on, its Da de Muertos.
I brought you a little offering.
Get outta here!
I would Chich, but the thing is...
me and my friend Miguel...
we really need to
borrow your guitar.
- My guitar?
- Yes.
My prized, beloved guitar?
I promise we'll bring it right back.
Like the time you promised
to bring back my van?
Eh...
- Or my mini fridge?
- Oh, you see...
Or my good napkins,
my lasso, my femur?!
No, not like those things.
Where's my femur, you...
Oh, oh.
You okay, amigo?
I'm fading, Hctor.
I can feel it.
I couldn't even play that
thing if I wanted to.
You, play me something.
Oh, you know I don't
play anymore, Chich.
The guitar's for the kid.
You want it?
You've got to earn it.
Ay, only for you, amigo.
Any requests?
You know my favorite, Hctor.
Well, everyone knows Juanita
Her eyes each a different color
Her teeth stick out
And her chin goes in
And her...
Knuckles they drag on the floor
Those aren't the words.
There are children present.
Her hair is like a brier
She stands in a
bow-legged stance
And if I weren't so ugly
She'd possibly
give me a chance
Brings back memories.
Gracias.
Wait, what happened?
He's been forgotten.
When there's no one left in the
living world who remembers you...
you disappear from this world.
We call it "The Final Death."
W-where did he go?
No one knows.
But I've met him.
I could remember him...
when I go back.
No, it doesn't work
like that, chamaco.
Our memories...
They have to be passed down
by those who knew us in life.
In the stories
they tell about us.
But there's no one left alive
to pass down Chich's stories.
Hey, it happens to
everyone eventually.
Come on, de la Cruzito,
you've got a contest to win.
You told me you hated musicians.
You never said you were one.
How do you think I knew
your great-great-grandpa?
We used to play music together.
Taught him everything he knows.
No manches.
You played with
Ernesto de la Cruz?
The greatest musician
of all time?
Oh! Oh, you're funny.
Greatest eyebrows
of all time, maybe.
But his music, eh, not so much.
You don't know what
you're talking about.
Welcome to the Plaza de la Cruz.
Showtime, chamaco.
Querer lo, t-shirts, bobbleheads.
Bienvenidos a todos!
Ow! ha-hah-ay!
Who's ready for some msica?
It's a Battle of
the Bands, amigos.
The winner gets to play
for the maestro himself...
Ernesto de la Cruz
on his fiesta tonight!
That's our ticket, muchacho.
Let the competition begin!
So, what's the plan?
W-what are you gonna play?
Definitely "Remember Me."
No, not that one. No.
Come on, it's the
most popular song.
Ah, it's too popular.
Remember me
though I have to travel far
Remember...
Don't let it make you cry
Um, what about...
Poco Loco?
Epa! Now, that's a song.
De la Cruzito!
You're on standby.
Los Chachalacos,
you're up next.
Los Chachalacos!
You always this nervous
before a performance?
I don't know.
I've never performed before.
What? You said
you were a musician!
I am! I mean, I-I will be.
- Ay!
- Once I win.
That's your plan?
No, no, no, no.
You have to win, Miguel.
Your life literally
depends on you winning.
And you've never
done this before?
- I'll go up.
- Uh, n-no!
- I need to do this.
- Why?
If I can't go out there
and play one song...
how can I call myself
a musician?
What does that matter?
'Cause I don't just want
to get de la Cruz' blessing.
I need to prove that...
that I'm worthy of it.
Oh. Oh, that's such
a sweet sentiment.
At such a bad time!
Okay! Okay, okay. Okay.
Okay, you wanna perform?
Then you've got to perform!
First, you have to loosen up.
Shake off those nerves.
Now, give me your best grito.
My best grito?
Come on, yell. Belt it out.
Haooeyy-he-he-hey!
Oh, it feels good.
Okay, now, now, now you.
A-a-eh.
Aeh...
Ay...
Ay...ay...
Ay...ay...ay.
Oh, come on, kid.
De la Cruzito!
You're on now!
Miguel, look at me.
Hey, hey, look at me.
Come on, let's go!
You can do this.
Grab their attention
and don't let it go!
Hctor...
Make them listen, chamaco.
You've got this.
De la Cruzito!
Arriba-Ba! Hey!
Eh...
What's he doing?
Why isn't he playing?
Bring back the singing dog!
Hunh!
Aah-aaah-aaayy!
What color is the sky?
Ay, mi amor, ay, mi amor
You tell me that it's red
Ay, mi amor, ay, mi amor
Where should I put my shoes?
Ay, mi amor, ay, mi amor
You say, "put them on your head!"
Ay, mi amor, ay, mi amor
You make me un poco loco
un poquititito loco
The way you keep me guessing
I'm nodding and I'm yesing
I'll count it as a blessing
That I'm only un poco loco
Not bad for a dead guy.
Not so bad yourself, gordito.
Eso!
He's close. Find him.
The loco that you make me
It is just un poco crazy
The sense that you're not making
The liberties you're taking
Leaves my cabeza shaking
You are just un poco loco
Numero uno, Miguelito!
Aah-haa-haaoo!
Rrrr-aaayy-aaayy!
We're looking for a living kid.
About twelve?
Have you seen a living boy?
Un poquiti-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti
ti-ti-ti-ti-to loco!
Aaah-aaoah-aah!
Hey! You did good!
I'm proud of you.
Eso!
Hey, where are you going?
We gotta get outta here.
What? You're crazy!
We're about to win this thing.
Damas y caballeros...
I have a emergency announcement.
Please be on the look out
for a living boy.
Answers to the name of Miguel.
Earlier tonight, he ran away
from his family.
They just want to send him
back to the Land of the Living.
Wait, wait, wait.
You said de la Cruz
was your only family.
The only person who
could send you home.
I do have other family, but...
You could have taken my
photo back this whole time?
But they hate music.
I need a musician's blessing.
- You lied to me!
- Oh, you're one to talk.
Look at me, I'm being
forgotten, Miguel.
I don't even know if I'm
gonna last the night.
I'm not gonna miss my one
chance to cross that bridge
'cause you want to live out
some stupid musical fantasy.
- It's not stupid.
- I'm taking you to your family.
- Let go of me.
- You'll thank me later.
You don't wanna help me.
You only care about yourself.
Keep your dumb photo.
- No!
No, no, no!
- Stay away from me!
No!
Hey, chamaco?
Where did you go?
Chamaco?
Sorry!
Come back.
Dante, cllate.
Don't Dante, stop it.
He can't help me.
Dante, stop.
Stop it.
Leave me alone!
You're not a spirit guide,
you're just a dumb dog.
Now get outta here!
It's him!
It's that living boy!
I've heard about him, look!
He's alive.
Huah!
Aah!
This nonsense ends now, Miguel!
I am giving you my blessing,
and you are going home.
I don't want your blessing.
Miguel! Stop!
Come back!
Miguel!
I am trying to save your life.
You're ruining my life.
What?
Music's the only thing
that makes me happy.
A-and you... you wanna
take that away.
You'll never understand.
Y aunque la vida
me cueste, Llorona
No dejar de quererte
I-I thought you hated music.
Oh, I loved it.
I remember that feeling.
When my husband would play,
and I would sing.
And nothing else mattered.
But when we had Coco...
suddenly, there was something in my
life that mattered more than music.
I wanted to put down rules.
He wanted to play for the world.
We each made a sacrifice
to get what we wanted.
Now, you must make a choice.
But I don't wanna pick sides.
Why can't you be on my side?
That's what family's
supposed to do.
Support you.
But you never will.
Have a good time.
Oh, how exciting!
Oh, El Santo!
I-I-I'm a big fan.
You mind if I?
Gracias, seor.
Invitation?
It's okay, I'm Ernesto's
great-great-grandson.
Heh.
Disculpe, seores.
Hey, hey, guys, it's Poco Loco!
You were on fire tonight.
You too!
Hey, musician to musician,
I need a favor.
Oh, the competition winners.
Congratulations, chicos.
Thanks guys.
Oh.
- Hey, enjoy the party, little msico.
- Gracias.
Ooh.
Look, it's Ernesto.
De la Cruz.
Seor de la Cruz!
Pardon me.
Seor de la Cruz!
Seor de la...
When you see your moment,
you mustn't let it pass you by.
You must seize it.
We're almost there, Dante.
Seor de la Cruz!
Seor de la...
But what can we do?
It is hopeless.
You must have faith, sister.
Oh, but Padre,
he will never listen.
He will listen to music.
Rrrr-aaoo-aaoo-aao-aahh!
Seoras y seores
Buenas tardes
Buenas noches
Seoritas y seores
To be here with you tonight
Brings me joy,
Que alegra
For this music is my language
And the world es mi familia
For this music is my language
And the world es mi familia
For this music is my language
And the woo-orld es mi familia
For this music is my Lang-
Ah!
Hunh!
Are you all right, nio?
Huah!
It-it's you.
Y-you are that boy.
The one who came from
the Land of the Living.
You... know about me?
You're all anyone
has been talking about.
Why have you come here?
I'm Miguel.
Your g-great-great-grandson.
I have a great-great-grandson?
I need your blessing.
So I can go back home and
be a musician just like you.
The rest of our family...
they wouldn't listen.
But I... I hoped you would.
My boy, with a talent like yours...
how could I not listen?
Haha! I have a
great-great-grandson!
Look, it's Frida!
Yes, it is I, Frida Kahlo.
It is an honor, seora.
Gracias.
Hey, Negrete, Infante.
Have you met my
great-great-grandson?
My great-great-grandson!
He is alive and a musician, to boot.
Dimple, no dimple.
Dimple, no dimple.
No dimple!
To our friendship. Haha!
I'd move heaven and earth
for you, mi amigo. Salud!
Poison!
You know, I did all my own stunts.
Though I have to say goodbye
Remember me
All of this came from my amazing
fans in the Land of the Living.
They leave me more offerings
than I know what to do with.
Hey, what's wrong?
Is it too much?
You look overwhelmed.
N-no, It's all great.
- But?
- It's just...
I've been looking up
to you my whole life.
You're the guy
who actually did it.
But did you ever regret it?
Choosing music
over everything else?
It was hard saying
goodbye to my hometown.
Heading off on my own.
Leaving your family?
Si.
But I could not have
done it differently.
One cannot deny
who one is meant to be.
And you, my great-great-grandson...
are meant to be a musician.
You and I, we are artists, Miguel.
We cannot belong to one family.
The world is our family!
Ooh-hoo! Ooh!
The fireworks have begun!
Soon, the party will move across
town for my sunrise spectacular.
Hunh! Miguel, you must
come to the show!
You will be my guest of honor.
- You mean it?
- Of course, my boy.
I can't.
I have to get home
before sunrise.
Oy! I really do need to get you home.
It has been an honor.
I am sorry to see you go, Miguel.
I hope you die very soon.
You know what I mean.
Miguel...
I give you my blessing.
We had a deal, chamaco.
Who are you?
What is the meaning of this?
Oh, Frida. I thought
you couldn't make it.
You said you'd take back my photo.
You promised, Miguel.
You know this uh, man?
I just met him tonight.
He told me he knew you.
H...Hctor?
Please, Miguel.
Put my photo up.
My friend. You're...
you're being forgotten.
And whose fault is that?
- Hctor, please.
- Those were my songs you took.
My songs that made you famous.
- What?
- If I'm being forgotten...
It's because you never told anyone
that I wrote them.
That's crazy. De la Cruz
wrote all his own songs.
You wanna tell him?
Or should I?
Hctor, I never meant to take credit.
We made a great team, but...
you died, and... I-I only sang
your songs because
I wanted to keep
a part of you alive.
Oh, how generous!
You really did play together.
Look, I don't want to fight about it.
I just want you to make it right.
Miguel can put my photo up.
- Hctor.
- And I can cross over the bridge.
I could see my girl.
Ernesto.
Remember the night I left?
That was a long time ago.
We drank together.
And you told me you would move
heaven and earth for your amigo.
Well, I'm asking you to now.
Heaven and earth?
Like in the movie?
What?
That's Don Hidalgo's toast.
In the de la Cruz movie,
"El Camino a Casa."
I'm talking about my real life, Miguel.
No, it's in there.
Look!
This calls for a toast.
To our friendship! Haha!
I would move heaven
and earth for you, mi amigo.
But in the movie, Don Hidalgo
poisons the drink.
Salud.
Poison!
That night, Ernesto.
The night I left.
We've been performing
on the road for months.
I got homesick
and I packed up my songs.
You wanna give up now?
When we're this close
to reaching our dream?
This was your dream.
You'll manage.
I can't do this
without your songs, Hctor.
I'm going home, Ernesto.
Hate me if you want.
But my mind is made up.
Oh, I could never hate you.
If you must go, then I'm...
I'm sending you off with a toast.
To our friendship.
I would move heaven
and earth for you, mi amigo.
Salud!
You walked me to the train station.
But I felt a pain in my stomach.
I thought it must have
been something I ate.
Perhaps it was that chorizo,
my friend.
Or something I drank.
I woke up dead.
You...
poisoned me!
You're confusing movies
with reality, Hctor.
All this time, I thought
it was just bad luck.
I never thought that you might have...
that you...
How could you?
Hctor!
Security! Security!
You took everything away from me!
You rat!
Have him taken care of.
He's not well.
I just wanted to move back home!
No! No!
I apologize.
Where were we?
You were going
to give me your blessing.
Yes... ah... Si.
Miguel...
My reputation... it is...
very important to me.
I would hate to have you think...
That you m-murdered Hctor
for his songs?
You don't think that.
Do you?
I... No... Everyone knows you're the...
the good guy.
Pap Ernesto...
my blessing?
Security?
Take care of Miguel.
He'll be extending his stay.
What?
But I'm your family!
And Hctor was my best friend.
Success doesn't come
for free, Miguel.
You have to be willing
to do whatever it takes to...
seize your moment.
I know you understand.
No! No!
Let go!
No!
Aah!
Help!
Can anyone hear me?
I wanna go home!
Huh?
H-Hctor?
- Kid?
- Oh, Hctor!
You were right.
I should have gone
back to my family.
- Hey, hey, hey.
- They told me not to be like de la Cruz.
- But I didn't listen.
- Hey, it's okay.
But I told them I didn't care
if they remembered me.
I didn't care if was on
the stupid ofrenda.
Hey, chamaco, it's okay.
It's okay.
I told them I didn't care.
- Huh! Oh!
- Hctor!
Hctor?
She's...
forgetting me.
Who?
My daughter.
She's the reason you wanted
to cross the bridge.
I just wanted to see her again.
I never should have left Santa Cecilia.
I wish I could apologize.
I wish I could tell her that her
Pap was trying to come home.
That he loved her so much.
My Coco.
Coco?
Where?
Where did you get this?
That's my Mam Coco.
That's my Mam Imelda.
Is that...
You?
We're...
- family?
- Family?
I always hoped I'd see her again.
That she'd miss me.
Maybe put up my photo.
But it never happened.
You know the worst part?
Even if I never got to see
Coco in the living world...
I thought at least one day,
I'd see her here.
Give her the biggest hug.
But she's the last person
who remembers me.
The moment she's gone
from the living world...
You disappear.
From this one.
You'll never get to see her.
Ever again.
You know...
I wrote her a song once.
We used to sing it every night.
At the same time.
No matter how far apart we were.
What I wouldn't give
to sing it to her.
One...
last...
time.
Remember me
Though I have to say goodbye
Remember me
Don't let it make you cry
For even if I'm far away
I hold you in my heart
I sing a secret song to you
Each night we are apart
Remember me
Pap!
Though I have to travel far
Remember me
Each time you hear a sad guitar
Know that I'm with you
The only way that I can be
Until you're in my arms again
Remember
Me
H-He stole your guitar.
He stole your songs.
You should be the one
the world remembers.
Not de la Cruz.
I didn't write "Remember Me"
for the world.
I wrote it for Coco.
I'm a pretty sorry excuse for a
great-great-grandpa.
Are you kidding? A minute ago,
I thought I was related to a murderer.
You're a total upgrade.
My whole life...
there's been something
that made me different.
And I never knew
where it came from.
But now, I know.
It comes from you!
I'm proud we're family.
I'm proud to be his family!
Rrrr-aayy!
Haaa-ooei!
Aaah-haha-ha-aayy!
I'm proud to be
his family!
Haooo-whoo-hoo!
Ho-ha-ay!
Dante?
Dante!
It's Dante!
Haha!
Imelda!
Hctor.
You look good.
Dante!
You knew he was my
Pap Hctor the whole time!
You are a real spirit guide.
Who's a good spirit guide?
You are!
Whoa!
Haha!
Dante!
There they are!
Miguelito! Miguelito!
Gracias, Dios mio!
Mijo, I was so worried.
Thank goodness
we found you in time.
And you.
How many times
must I turn you away?
Imelda...
I want nothing to do with you.
Not in life, not in death.
I spent decades protecting
my family from your mistakes.
He spends five minutes with you,
and I have to fish him out of a sinkhole!
I wasn't in there 'cause of Hctor.
He was in there 'cause of me.
He was just trying to get me home.
I didn't wanna listen.
But he was right.
Nothing is more
important than family.
I'm ready to accept your blessing.
And your conditions.
But first, I need to find de la Cruz.
To get Hctor's photo.
- What?
- So he can see Coco again.
Hctor should be on our ofrenda.
He's part of our family.
He left this family.
He tried to go home to you and Coco.
But de la Cruz murdered him.
It's true, Imelda.
And so what if it's true?
You leave me alone
with a child to raise,
and I'm just supposed
to forgive you?
Imelda, I...
Hctor?
Hunh!
I'm running out of time.
It's Coco.
She's forgetting you.
You don't have to forgive him.
But we shouldn't forget him.
I wanted to forget you.
I wanted Coco
to forget you too, but...
This is my fault.
Not yours.
I'm sorry, Imelda.
Miguel...
If we help you get his photo...
you will return home.
No more music.
Family comes first.
I... I can't forgive you.
But I will help you.
So how do we get to
de la Cruz?
I might know a way.
Good luck, muchacho.
Gracias, Frida.
Ah!
Here, let me help you with...
Don't touch me.
Everyone clear on the plan?
Find Hctor's photo.
Give it to Miguel.
Send Miguel home.
Got your petals?
Now, we just have to find de la Cruz.
- Yes?
- Ah!
Don't I know you?
That's for murdering
the love of my life!
- Who the?
- She's talking about me.
I'm the love your your life?
I don't know,
I'm still angry at you.
Hctor? How did you...
And that's for trying
to murder my grandson!
- Grandson?
- She's talking about me.
You!
Wait. You're related to Hctor?
The photo!
Eh...
After him!
Security, ayuda.
You said love of your life?
I don't know what I said.
That's what I heard.
Places, seor.
You're on in 30 seconds.
Miguel, I have it!
Oh!
Hurry, come on!
Ladies and gentleman!
The one. The only.
Ernesto de la Cruz!
Get her off the stage!
Sing!
Sing!
Ay
de m, Llorona
Llorona de azul Celeste
Ay de m, Llorona
Llorona de azul Celeste
Y aunque la vida me cueste,
Llorona
No dejar de quererte
No dejar de quererte
Me sub Al pino ms alto,
Llorona
A ver Si Te divisaba
Como El pino era tierno,
Llorona
Al verme llorar, lloraba
Ay de m, Llorona, Llorona
Llorona de azul Celeste
Ay de m, Llorona, Llorona
Llorona de azul Celeste
Y aunque la vida me cueste,
Llorona
No dejar de quererte
Y aunque la vida me cueste
- Let go of me!
Llorona
No dejar de quererte
No dejar de quererte
No dejar de quererte
Ay, ay, ay!
I forgot what that felt like.
You... still got it.
Uh-h-hum...
Oh!
Miguel, I give you my blessing...
To go home...
To put up our photos...
And to never...
Never play music again.
To never forget how much
your family loves you.
You're going home.
You're not going anywhere!
Imelda!
Stay back! Stay back!
All of you, stay back!
Not one more step.
Dante!
Ernesto, stop!
Leave the boy alone.
I've worked too hard, Hctor.
Too hard to let him
destroy everything.
He's a living child, Ernesto.
He's a threat.
You think I'd let him go back to the
Land of the Living with your photo?
To keep your memory alive?
- No.
- You're a coward!
I am Ernesto de la Cruz.
The greatest musician of all time.
Hctor's the real musician.
You're just the guy who
murdered him and stole his songs.
Murdered?
I am the one who's
willing to do what it takes
to seize my moment.
Whatever it takes.
Aah! Aah!
No!
- Miguel!
- Miguel!
Apologies, old friend.
But the show must go on.
Haha!
Boo! Boo!
Boo!
Hahaha! Please, please,
mi familia!
- Murderer!
- Get off the stage!
Orchestra, a-one, a-two, a-one...
Remember me
Though I have to s-
Hey, creep!
Look!
Nice kitty.
Ah!
Put me down!
Please!
I'm begging you!
Stop, stop!
Aaah!
Aah! Aaah!
Oooh!
Oh! No!
Aaah!
Hunh!
What did I miss?
Good boy, Dante.
Miguel!
Oh!
Hctor!
The photo, I lost it.
It's okay, mijo.
It's...
Hctor!
Hctor?
Coco.
No, we can still find the photo.
Miguel, it's almost sunrise.
No, no, no.
I can't leave you.
I promised I put your photo up.
I promised you'd see Coco.
We're both out of time, mijo.
No! No!
She can't forget you.
I just wanted her to know...
that I loved her.
Hctor!
You have our blessing, Miguel.
No conditions.
No, Pap Hctor. Please!
No.
Go home.
I promise! I-I won't let
Coco forget you!
There he is!
Miguel! Stop!
Where have you been?
Ah! I need to see
Mam Coco, please!
Huh! What are you doing with that?
Give it to me!
Miguel, stop.
Miguel! Miguel?
Miguel!
Mam Coco?
Can you hear me?
It's Miguel.
I-I saw your Pap!
Remember? Pap?
Please.
If you forget him.
He'll be gone.
Forever.
Here. This was his guitar, right?
He used to play it to you?
See, there he is.
Pap, remember? Pap?
Miguel!
Mam Coco, please.
Don't forget him.
What are you doing
to that poor woman?
It's okay, mother.
What's gotten into you?
I thought I lost you, Miguel.
I'm sorry, Pap.
We're all together now.
That's what matters.
Not all of us.
It's okay, Mamita.
Miguel, you apologize
to your Mam Coco.
Mam Coco...
Well, apologize.
Mam Coco...
Your Pap...
He wanted you to have this.
Mam... wait...
Remember me
Though I have to say goodbye
Remember me
Don't let it make you cry
For even if I'm far away
- Look!
I hold you in my heart
I sing a secret song to you
Each night we are apart
Remember me
Though I have to travel far
Remember me
Each time you hear a sad guitar
Know that I'm with you
The only way that I can be
Until you're in my arms again
Remember
Me
Elena?
What's wrong, mija?
Nothing, Mam.
Nothing at all.
My Pap used to
sing me that song.
He loved you, Mam Coco.
Your Pap loved you so much.
I kept his letters.
Poems he wrote me.
And...
Pap was a musician.
When I was a little girl...
He and Mam would sing
such beautiful songs.
One year later
Remember me
Forgotten.
And right over here,
one of Santa Cecilia's
greatest treasures.
The home of the esteemed
songwriter, Hctor Rivera.
The letters Hctor wrote
home for his daughter, Coco
contain the lyrics for all
of your favorite songs.
Not just "Remember Me."
And that man is your Pap Julio.
And there's Ta Rosita.
And your Ta Victoria.
And those two are
Oscar and Felipe.
There aren't just old pictures,
they're our family.
And they're counting on us
to remember them.
Say that I'm crazy
- Next.
Or call me a fool
Enjoy your visit, Hctor.
But last night it seemed
that I dreamed about you
Pap!
Coco!
And you knew every word
And we all sang along
To a melody played
On the strings of our souls
And a rhythm that rattled us
Down to the bone
Our love for each other
Will live on forever
In every beat
Of my proud corazn
Our love for each other
Will live on forever
In every beat
Of my proud corazn
Ay mi familia
Oiga mi gente
Canten a coro
Let it be known
Our love for each other
Will live on forever
In every beat
Of my proud corazn
Ay mi familia
Oiga mi gente
Canten a coro
Let it be known
Our love for each other
Will live on forever
In every beat
Of my proud corazn


Legend tells of a legendary warrior,
whose kung fu skills
were the stuff of legend.
He travelled the land
in search of worthy foes.
I see you like to chew.
Maybe you should on my fist.
The warrior said anything
for his mouth was full.
Then he swallowed.
And then he spoke.
Enough talk. Let's fight.
He was so deadly in fact,
that his enemies will go blind,
from over exposure to pure
awesomeness.
My eyes!
He's too awesome!
And attractive.
How can we re-pay you?
There is no charge for awesomeness.
Or attractiveness.
It mattered not how many foes he faced.
They were no match for his voracity.
Never before had a panda
been so feared, and so loved.
Even the most heroic heroes
in all of China,
The Furious Five.
Bowed in respect to this great master.
We should hang out.
Agreed.
But hanging out would
have to wait.
Cause when you're facing the ten
thousand demons of demon mountain.
There is only one thing
that matters and thats...
Get up!
You'll be late for work.
Po...
Get up!
Hey, Po.
What are you doing up there?
Ahh.. nothing.
Monkey, Mantis, Crane, Viper,
Tigress ... Roarrrr!
Ahh...
Po. Let's go.
You're late for work.
Coming!
Sorry Dad.
Sorry, doesn't make the Noodles.
What were you doing up there?
All that noise?
Oh...nothing.
Just had a crazy dream.
About what? Uh?
What were you dreaming about?
What was I...aah...
... I was dreaming about a...
Noodles.
Noodles?
You were really dreaming about noodles?
Uhh... Ya,
what else would I be dreaming about?
Oh, careful.
That soup is - sharp!
Oh... happy day.
My son finally having the noodle dream.
You don't know how long
I have been waiting for this moment.
This is a sign, Po.
Uh... a sign of what?
You are almost ready to be
entrusted with the secret ingredient,
... of my secret ingredient soup.
And then you will fulfill your destiny
and take over the restaurant.
Just as I took over from my father
who took over from his father.
who won it from a friend
over a game of mahjong.
Dad, dad, dad.
It was just a dream.
No, it was the Dream.
Wu Xiang noodles.
Po, broth runs through our veins.
But Dad, didn't you ever
wanted to do something else?
Something, beside noodles.
Actually, when I was young
and crazy.
I thought of running away
and learning how to make tofu.
So why didn't you?
Oh, because it was
a stupid dream.
Can you imagine me making tofu?
Ha, ha, ha. Tofu!
No, we all have our place
in this world.
My is here and yours is...
... I know "is here".
No, its tables 2, 5 ,7 and 12.
Service with a smile.
Well done, students...
... if you were trying
to disappoint me.
Tigress, you need more ferocity.
Monkey greater speed.
Crane, height. Viper, subtlety.
Mantis... Master Shifu...
Master Shifu... What?
It...its Master Oogway,
he wants to see you.
Master Oogway, you summoned me?
Is something wrong?
Why must something be wrong
for me to want to see my old friend?
So, nothing is wrong?
Well, I didn't say that.
You were saying?
I have had a vision.
Tai Lung will return.
That is impossible.
He's in prison.
Nothing is impossible.
Zeng, fly to Chordom Prison.
Tell them to double the guards,
Double the weapons.
Double everything.
Tai Lung does not leave
that prison.
Yes, Master Shifu.
One often meets his destiny on
the road he takes to avoid it.
We have to do something. We can't
just have him march in the valley.
And take his revenge.
He'll, he'll...
Your mind is like this water
my friend. When it is agitated...
... it becomes difficult to see.
But if you allow it to settle,
the answer becomes clear.
The Dragon's scroll.
It is time.
But who?
Who is worthy to be trusted
with the secret to limitless power?
To become the Dragon Warrior.
I don't know.
Excuse me. Sorry.
Oo...oo sorry.
Hey, watch it Po.
Sorry.
Aah... Oop!
Sorry, a thousand pardon.
What?
Master Oogway is choosing
a Dragon Warrior, today.
Everyone, everyone, go!
Get to the Jade Palace!
One of the five is going
to get the Dragon's Scroll.
We have been waiting a thousand
years for this. Just take the bowl!
This is the greatest day in Kung Fu
history! Don't worry about it. Just go!
Po! Where are you going?
To the Jade Palace.
But you're forgetting your noodle cart.
The whole valley will be there and
you will sell noodle to all of them.
Selling noodles?
But Dad. You know I was kind
of thinking, maybe I...
Ya?
I was kind of thinking, maybe I...
Ahh...Haa..?
Could also sell the bean buns.
They're about to go bad.
That's my boy!
I told you that dream was a sign.
Ya...
I'm glad I had it.
Almost there.
What?
No!
No! No!
Sorry Po.
We'll bring you back a souvenir.
No, I'll bring you back a souvenir.
It's a historic day.
Isn't it Master Oogway?
Yes. The one I feared
I would not live to see.
Are your students ready?
Yes, Master Oogway.
Now know this old friend...
Whomever I chose will not only bring
peace to the valley, but also to you.
Let the tournament begin!
No, no, no, wait!
I'm coming.
Hey! Open the door.
Let me in!
Citizens of the Valley of Peace.
It is my great honour
to present to you,
Tigress, Viper, Crane, Monkey, Mantis.
The Furious Five!
Ah...Ah...Ahh...
They're The Furious Five!
Aah..aah... ouch!
Warriors prepare!
Blast, No, Quick Po.
Ready for battle.
The thousand tons of fire!
Ho...ha...howw!
Wow... Look at that!
Hey! Get out of the way!
Uhh...Oh...ohh!
Ah...ah...aah!
Hiyaah...ouch!
And finally, Master Tigress.
Believe me citizens,
you have not seen anything yet.
I know!
Master Tigress faces Iron Arms
and its Blades of Death.
I sense the Dragon Warrior
is among us.
Citizens of the Valley of Peace,
Master Oogway will now choose
the Dragon Warrior.
Hah...butta...
No, no, no wait!
Yaa...ahh.
Ha...ha...haah!
Ha...ha...haah.
Po! What are you doing?
What does it look
like I'm doing?
Stop! Stop!
I'm going to see the Dragon Warrior.
But I don't understand,
you finally have the noodle dream.
I lied.
I don't dream about noodles, Dad.
I love Kung Fu...uuu!
Oh come on son.
Let's get back to work.
Heay...okay.
Ahh...aahh...aah.
Po!...Heay...heay...hey.
Oh...Somebody...
Oh. What's going on?
... Where?
Why are you pointing...?
Oh. Okay. Sorry. I just wanted
to see who the Dragon Warrior was?
How interesting?
Master, are you pointing at me?
Him.
Who?
You.
Me?
The universe has brought
us the Dragon Warrior.
What? What?
What? What!
Stop wait.
Who told you to...
Master Oogway, wait.
That crabby panda can't possibly
be the answer to our problem.
You were about to appoint the Tigress.
and that thing fell in front of her.
That was just an accident.
There are no accidents.
Forgive us Master.
We have failed you.
No. If the panda has not quit by
morning, then I would have failed you.
Wait, wait, wait!
I bring a message from Master Shifu.
What? Double the guard.
Extra precautions.
Your prison may not be adequate?
You doubt my prison security?
Absolutely not!
Shifu does.
I'm just the messenger.
I'll give you a message
for your Master Shifu.
Escape from Chordom prison
is impossible.
Impressive isn't it?
Yes, very impressive.
It is very impressive.
One way in.
And one way out.
One thousand guards
and one prisoner.
Yes, except that prisoner is Tai Lung.
Take us down.
Ahh...ahh...ahh...ahh
Oh...oo...oh..
Oh my...
Behold Tai Lung.
I'll umm...I'll just
wait right here.
It's nothing to worry about.
It's perfectly safe.
Both posts.
At the ready.
Hey tough guy.
Did you hear...
Oogway is finally going to give
someone the Dragon Scroll...
...and it's not going to be you.
What are you doing?
Don't get him mad.
What is he going to do about it?
I've got him completely immobilised.
Haa...haa...haa...haa!
Oh...Did I step on
the wooly kiddy's tail?
I'm gonna... I've seen enough.
I'm gonna tell Shifu that he
has nothing to worry about.
No, he doesn't.
Okay I'll tell him that.
Hmm...
Can we please go now?
Oh. Wait a second.
I think there has been
a slight mistake.
Err...Everyone seems
to think I'm err...
Ahh...The sacred Hall of Warriors.
No way.
Look at this place.
Master Flying-Rhino's armour.
With authentic battle damage!
Wow...the Sword of Heroes.
Said to be so sharp, you can cut
yourself just by looking ... Aah!...Oww!
The invisible Dragon of Destiny.
Uuhhs... I've only seen paintings
of that painting.
Aah...ah...ha...ha...ha...
Heeyah...yah.. Aah...ah...ah..
Noo..! Ho...oh, oh, oh...
The legendary Urn of Whispering Warriors.
Said to contain souls of the
entire Tenshu army.
Hello?
Have you finished sightseeing?
Sorry. I should have
come to see you first.
My patience is running thin.
Ohh?
Well. I mean, it's not like
you are going anywhere.
You turn around.
Sure.
Hey, how is it going?
How do you get 500...Master Shifu!... Ooh!...
Ohh...whooo...
Someone broke that...
But I'm going to fix it...I...
Do you have some glue...
Whooo....
Aah...ouch...ooo!
I've a splinter.
So you are the legendary Dragon Warrior?
Hmm...
Ahh, I guess so?
Wrong!
You are not the Dragon Warrior.
You will never be the Dragon Warrior...
... until you've learned the secret
of the Dragon scroll.
Wow...so...
How does this work?
Do you have a ladder?
a trampoline or...?
Umph...You think it is that easy?
That I'm just going to hand you
the secret to limitless power?
No! I...
One must first master the highest
level of Kung Fu
and that is clearly impossible
if that one is someone like you.
Someone like me?
Yes!
Look at you!
This fat blob. Flabby arms.
Those are sensitive.
in the flabby parts.
And this ridiculous belly.
Hey...whooo...
And utter disregard for personal hygiene.
Now wait a minute.
That's a little uncalled for.
Don't stand that close. I can smell your breath.
Listen, Oogway said that I was the...
Uh... the Wushi Finger Hold.
Never... Master Shifu don't...
Haa...oh... You know this hold?
Developed by Master Wushi in the
Oh. Then you must know what happens
when I flex my pinky.
No, no, no...
You know the hardest part of this?...
The hardest part is cleaning up afterwards.
Humm...
Okay. Okay, take it easy.
Now listen closely, Panda.
Oogway may have picked you,
but when I'm through with you,...
I promise you,
you're going to wish he hadn't.
Are we clear?
Yes, we're clear, we're clear.
We are so clear.
Good. Hmm, Hmm, Hmm.
I can't wait to get started.
Let's begin.
Wait, wait, wait.
Now?
Yes now.
Unless you think that the great Oogway was
wrong and you are not the Dragon Warrior.
Okay. Well, I don't know
if I can do all of those moves.
Well, if we don't try,
we will never know, will we?
Yes, it's just, maybe we can find
something more suited to my level.
And what level is that?
Well you know...
I'm not a master, but
let's just start at zero.
Level zero.
There is no such thing as level zero.
Hey, maybe I can start with that.
That. We use that
for training children.
And popping the door
open when it is hot.
But if you insist.
Wow... The Furious Five.
You're so much bigger
than your action figures.
Except for you, Mantis.
You're about the same.
Go ahead, Panda.
Show us what you can do.
Ahh...Are they going to watch? Or should I just
wait until they get back to work or something?
Hit it.
Okay, I mean, I just ate,
and so I'm still digesting, so my
Kung Fu may not be as good as later on.
Just hit it.
What'd you got?
You've got nothing cos' I got it right here.
You picking on my friends?
Get ready to fell the thunder.
Come on, crazy feet.
What're you going to do about crazy feet?
Come on. I'm a blur. I'm a blur.
You've never seen Bear style.
You've only seen Praying Mantis.
Or Monkey style.
Imagine snake-kiddy Snake.
Would you hit it!
Alright. Alright.
Why don't you try it again?
A little harder.
How's that?
Oohhh...
Oh, that hurts!
This will be easier than I thought.
Feeling a little nausea...
Ouch, ouch, ouch!
Oohh... My tenders.
How did I do?
There is now a level zero.
Don't deny that.
I don't understand what Master Oogway was thinking.
Poor guy is going to get himself killed.
He is so fighty.
The Dragon Warrior fell out
of the sky in a ball of fire.
When he walks,
the very ground shakes.
One would think that Master Oogway would
choose someone who actually knew Kung Fu.
Yes. Or could at least touch his toes.
Or even see his toes.
Okay.
Great.
Ooouuch!
Oh hey. Hi.
You're up?
Am now.
I was just..er...someday...eh?
The Kung Fu stuff is hard work, right?
Your biceps sore.
I've had a long day and rather
disappointing day, so...er...
Ya...I should probably get to sleep now.
Ya... Ya...of course.
Okay. Thanks.
It's just, I'm such a big fan...
You guys were so totally amazing
at the battle of the Weeping River.
Outnumbered. A thousand to one.
But, you didn't stop. You just,....
Oh. Sorry about that.
Ahh... Look you don't belong here.
Er...I know, I know.
You're right.
I don't have it.
It's just, my whole life, I dream of...
No, no, no. I meant you don't
belong here, I mean in this room.
But this is my room.
Property of Crane.
Oh, okay right, right.
So...
Ya, you want to get to sleep.
Keeping you up.
We've got big things tomorrow.
Alright. You are awesome. The last thing
I'm going to say. Okay, bye-bye.
What was that?
I didn't say anything.
Okay. Alright. Goodnight.
Sleep well.
Seem a little bit awkward.
Master Tigress, didn't mean
to wake you. Just a...
You don't belong here.
Ah ya...ya, of course...
This is your room...
I mean you don't belong in the Jade Palace.
You're a disgrace to Kung Fu and if
you have any respect of who we are,
and what we do,
you will be gone by morning.
Big fan.
I see you've found the Sacred Peach
Tree of Heavenly Wisdom.
Is that what this is?
I'm so sorry.
I thought it was just
a regular peach tree.
I understand, you eat
when you are upset.
Upset? I'm not upset.
Why would I be upset?
So, why are you upset?
I probably sucked more today
than anyone in the history of Kung Fu.
In the history of China.
In the history of sucking.
Probably.
And the Five...man,
you should have seen them,
they totally hate me.
Totally.
How's Shifu ever going to turn me
into the Dragon Warrior?
I mean I'm not like the Five,
I've got no claws.
No wings,
no venom.
Even Mantis got those thingies.
May be I should just quit
and go back to making noodles.
Quit. Don't quit.
Noodles. Don't noodles.
You are too concerned with
what was and what will be.
There's a saying.
Yesterday is history,
Tomorrow is a mystery,
But today is a gift.
That is why it is called the "present".
Oh No!
What's happening?
To your battle stations!
Go! Go! Go!
Fire Cross-Bow!
Fire!
Fire!
Tai Lung's free. I must warn Shifu.
You are not going anywhere.
Neither is he!
Let go of me.
Bring it up!
Wait! Bring it back!
He's going this way.
He won't get far.
Archers!
We Dead.
So very, very dead.
Ha..Ha. Not yet, we're not.
Now!
Can we run now?
Yes.
I am glad Shifu sent you.
I was beginning to feel
I'm being forgotten.
Fly back there and tell them, the
real Dragon Warrior is coming home.
Good Morning, Master.
Panda!
Panda! Wake up!
Hmm, hmm, hmm...
He's quitted.
What do we do now Master
with the Panda gone?
Who will be the Dragon Warrior?
All we can do is resume our training
and trust that in time...
the true Dragon Warrior will be revealed.
What are you doing here?
Haa...hey.
Good Morning Master.
I thought I'll warm up a little.
You're stuck.
Stuck?...No...What?...Stuck?
No...This is one of the...
Ya...I'm stuck.
Help him.
Oh dear.
Lift me on three.
One, two, ....
Thank you.
Don't mention it.
No really. I appreciate it...
...Ever.
You actually thought you could
learn to do a full split in one night.
It takes years to develop
ones flexibility.
And years longer to apply it in combat.
Put that down!
The only souvenirs we collect down here
are bloody knuckles and broken bones.
Yaa...ha...ha...ha.
Excellent!
Let's get started.
Are you ready?
I was born ready...Oww!
Oww!...Oh!. I'm sorry brother.
I thought you said you're ready.
That was awesome!
Let's go again!
I've been taking it easy on you Panda
but no more. Your next opponent...
...will be me.
Alright. Ya...Let's go!
Step forth!
The true path to victory is to find
your opponent's weakness.
And make him suffer for it.
Oh yeah. To take his strength
and use it against him.
Until he finally falls or quits.
But a real warrior never quits.
Don't worry Master, I'll never quit.
If he is smart he won't
come back those steps.
But he will.
He's not going to quit, is he?
He's not going to quit bouncing.
I'll tell you that.
Oouch! I thought you said
accupuncture will make me feel better.
Trust me it will.
It's just not easy finding right nerve points
under all this...fat?
Fur!
I was going to say fur.
Sure you were.
Who am I to judge a warrior
based on his size?
So I mean, look at me.
I'm over here.
Haa...aah...
Maybe you should take a look at this again.
Ohh... Okay.
Oouch!
Stop! Stop it!
Eee...ouch!
I know Master Shifu is trying
to inspire me and all.
But if I didn't know any better
I'll say he's trying to get rid of me.
I know he can seem like heartless.
Aaahh...!
But you know he wasn't
always like that.
According to legend there was once a time
when Master Shifu actually used to spy...
No...
Yes, but that was before...
Before what?
Before Tai Lung.
Aah...ya.
We are not really suppose to talk about him.
Well if he is going to stay here
he should now.
Guys, guys,
I know about Tai Lung.
He was a student. The first to ever
master the 1000 scrolls of Kung Fu.
And then he turned bad
and now he's in jail.
He wasn't just a student.
Shifu found him as a cub.
And he raised him as his son.
And when the child showed
talent in Kung Fu
Shifu trained him.
He believed in him. He told him
he was destined for greatness.
It was never enough for Tai Lung.
He wanted the Dragon Scroll.
But Oogway saw darkness
in his heart and refused.
Outraged, Tai Lung
laid waste to the Valley.
He tried to take the Scroll by force.
And Shifu has to destroy
what he had created.
But how could he?
Shifu loved Tai Lung like he
has never love anyone before.
What's it?
And now he has a chance
to make things right.
To train the true Dragon Warrior.
And he is stuck with you.
A big fat Panda who
treats it like a joke.
Ohh... That's it!
Wait! My fault!
I accidentally tweaked his facial nerves.
And may have also stopped his heart.
Inner peace.
Inner peace.
Inner...in...in...in
inner peace.
Look whoever is making that
flapping sound quiet down.
Inner...Quaaa!
Oh, Zeng, excellent.
I could use some good news now.
Aaahh....
Master. Master.
Hmm...
I...I..have ...It's a...
It's a very bad news.
Aah... Shifu. There's just news.
No good or bad.
Master, your vision was right.
Tai Lung has broken out of prison.
He's on his way.
That is bad news...
... if you do not believe that
the Dragon Warrior can stop him.
Panda? Master, that Panda
is not the Dragon Warrior.
He wasn't even meant to be here.
It was an accident.
There are no accidents.
Yes, I know.
You said that already.
Twice.
Well, that was no accident either.
Thrice.
My old friend.
The Panda will never fulfill
his destiny, nor you, yours.
Until you let go of the
illusion of control.
Illusion?
Yes.
Look at this tree, Shifu.
I cannot make it blossom
when it suits me.
Nor make it bear
fruit before it's time.
But there are things
we can control.
I can control when
the fruit will fall.
I can control where
to plant the seed.
That is no illusion, Master.
Ah...yes, but no matter
what you do
That seed will grow
to be a peach tree.
You may wish for an
apple or an orange.
But you will get a peach.
But a peach cannot defeat Tai Lung.
Maybe it can, if you are willing
to guide it, to nurture it.
To believe in it.
But how? How?
I need your help, Master.
No, you just need to believe.
Promise me, Shifu.
Promise me, you will believe.
I... I will try.
Hmm...Good.
My time has come.
You must continue your journey
without me.
What?...what?...what are you...
Wait!
Master.
You can't leave me.
You must believe.
Master.
I'm not scared...yet.
Sound like fun. He maybe a wolf.
You may be the scariest bandit
in Harjin Province.
But you're a lousy tipper.
Really.
So, how did you
get out of there alive?
I mean I didn't actually said that,
but I thought it, in my mind.
If he could read my mind
he would have been like...what?
Order up!
You like it?
This is really good.
Now, come on. You should try
my dad's secret ingredient soup.
He actually knows the secret ingredient.
What are you talking about?
This is amazing.
Wow...you are really a good cook.
I wish my mouth was bigger.
Tigress, you got to try this.
Hmm...
It is said that the Dragon Warrior can
survive for months at a time on nothing
but the dew of a single Gingko leaf
and the energy of the universe.
I guess my body doesn't know
it's the Dragon Warrior yet.
I need lard more than dew
and the universe juice.
What?
Oh nothing, Master Shifu.
Ha...ha...ha...ha!
You will never be the Dragon Warrior
unless you lose 500 pounds.
and brush your teeth.
What is the noise you're making?
Laughter?
I have never heard of it.
Work hard Panda and maybe someday
you'll have ears like mine.
That's good.
Oh...oh, yup.
Ears?
It's not working for you.
I thought they're pretty good.
It's Shifu!
Of course it's Shifu.
What do you think I'm doing?
Master Shifu.
Aahh...
You think this is funny!
Tai Lung has escaped from prison!
And you all are acting like children!
What?
He's coming for the Dragon Scroll and
you're the only one who can stop him.
Ha...and here I am saying you've
got no a sense of humour.
I am gonna... step down.
What? You're serious?
And I have to...aaa...not...
Master Oogway will stop him.
He did it before. He'll do it again.
Oogway cannot!
Not anymore.
Haa?
Our only hope is the Dragon Warrior.
The Panda?
Yes, the Panda!
Master please, let us stop Tai Lung?
This is what you train us for!
No! It is not your destiny to defeat
Tai Lung! It is his!
Where did he go?
You cannot leave!
A real warrior never quit!
Watch me!
Come on! How am I suppose
to beat Tai Lung?
I can't even beat you to the stairs.
You will beat him because
you are the Dragon Warrior.
Ouch!
You don't believe that!
Oh! You never believed that.
From the first moment I got here,
you've been trying to get rid of me.
Yes, I was!
But now I ask you to trust in your Master
as I have come to trust in mine.
You are not my Master.
And I am not the Dragon Warrior.
Then why didn't you quit?
You knew I was trying to get rid of you.
Yet you stayed.
Ya. I stayed.
I stayed because every time
you threw a brick at my head
Or said I smelled, it hurt!
But it could never hurt more than it
did everyday in my life just being me.
I stayed because I thought if anyone
could change me, could make me not me...
...it was you. The greatest
Kung Fu teacher of all of China.
But I can change you! I can turn
you into the Dragon Warrior. And I will!
Come on, Tai Lung is
on his way right now.
And even if it takes him
a hundred years to get here.
How are you going to change
this into the Dragon Warrior?
Hah?
How?
How?
How?
I don't know!
I do not know
That's what I thought.
This is what she trains for it
Tigress!
Don't try and stop me.
We are not trying to stop you.
What?
We are coming with you.
What?
I eat when I am upset, okay!
Oh! No need to explain.
I just thought you might be monkey.
He hides his almond cookies in the top-shelf.
Don't tell Monkey.
Look at you.
Yaaa..!
I know I disgust you.
No, I mean, how did you get up there?
I don't know,...I...
I don't know. Just get the cookies.
And yet you are 10 feet off the ground
and have done a perfect split.
No, this?
This is just an accident!
I know you are trying to be
all mystical and Kung Fu-ee.
But could you least tell me
where we are going?
You drag me all the way
out here for a bath?
Panda, we do not wash our pits
in the pool of sacred tears.
Uuh?...The pool of...
This is where Oogway unraveled
the mysteries of harmony and focus.
This is the birth place of Kung Fu.
Do you want to learn Kung Fu?
Yes
Then I am your Master.
Okay!
Don't cry.
Okay.
When you focus on Kung Fu,
when you concentrate, you stink.
But perhaps that is my fault.
I cannot train you the way I trained the Five.
I see now that the way to get
through to you is with this.
Aah great, cause I am hungry.
Good, when you have been trained
you may eat.
Let's begin.
After you, Panda.
Just like that.
No sit-ups. No, ten-mile hike.
I vowed to train you and you've been
trained. You are free to eat.
Enjoy
Hey!
I said you are free to eat.
Have a dumpling.
You are free to eat.
Am I?
Are you?
I am not hungry.
Master.
Cut it!
Where is the Dragon Warrior?
How do you know you are not looking at her?
You think I'm a fool.
I know you are not the Dragon Warrior.
None of you!
I heard how he fell out of the sky
on a ball of fire.
But he's a warrior unlike anything
in the world has ever seen.
Po?
So that is his name.
Po!
Finally, a worthy opponent.
The battle will be legendary.
We got this, help her.
Monkey!
Jump!
Mantis!
Now!
Shifu, taught you well.
But he didn't teach you everything.
You have done well, Panda.
Done well?
Done well!
I have done awesome!
The mark of a true hero is humility.
But yes,
you have done, awesome.
Five?
Fives!
They're dead.
No, they are breathing.
They're asleep?
No, their eyes are open.
We were no match for
his nerve attack.
He has gotten stronger.
Tai Lung?
Stronger!
He's too fast.
Sorry, Po.
I thought we could stop him.
He could have kill you.
Why didn't he?
So you can come back here...
...and strike fear into our hearts.
But it won't work.
It might. I mean a little.
I'm pretty scared.
You can defeat him, Panda.
Are you kidding?
If they can't... They're Five Masters.
I'm just one me.
But you have the one thing
that no one else does,
You really believe I'm ready.
You are, Po.
Behold, the Dragon Scroll.
It is yours.
Wait.
What happens when I read it?
No one knows.
But legend says you will be able
to hear a butterfly's wings beat.
Wow! Really? That's cool.
Yes!
And see light in the deepest cave.
You will feel the universe in motion around you.
Wow! Can I punch through walls?
Can I do a quadruple back flip?
Focus. Focus. Focus!
Oh, ya...yah.
Read it Po.
And fulfill your destiny.
Read it and become the Dragon Warrior.
Wow...!
It's impossible to open.
Thank you.
Probably, loosen it up for you.
Okay, here goes.
Aargh...!
It's blank.
What?
Here, look.
No, I am forbidden to look upon it.
Blank!
I don't...I don't understand.
Okay. So like Oogway was
just a crazy old turtle after all.
No. Oogway was wiser than us all.
Oh, come on.
Face it. He picked me by accident.
Of course I'm not Dragon Warrior.
Who am I kidding?
But who will stop Tai Lung?
He will destroy everything.
And everyone.
No.
Evacuate the Valley.
You must protect the villagers...
... from Tai Lung's rage.
What about you, Master?
I will fight him.
What?
I can hold him off long enough
for everyone to escape.
But Shifu, he'll kill you.
Then I would have finally
paid for my mistake.
Listen to me, all of you.
It's time for you to continue
your journey without me.
I am very proud to have
been your master.
We got to get them out safely.
Come little one, let's find your Mama.
Viper, gather the southern farmers.
Mantis, the north.
Crane, light the way.
Look, it's the Dragon Warrior.
Hey Dad.
Po!
It's good to have you back son.
Good to be back.
Let's go Po.
For our next shop, it's time to face it.
The future of noodles is diced cut vegetables.
No longer slices.
Also, I was thinking...
... maybe this time we'll have
a kitchen you can stand up in.
Hmm!
You like that?
Po, I'm sorry things didn't work out.
It just wasn't meant to be.
Po, forget everything else.
Your destiny still awaits.
We are noodle-folk.
Broth runs deep through our veins.
I don't know dad. Honestly,
sometimes I can't believe I'm your son.
Po, I think it's time I told you
something I should have told you...
... a long time ago.
Okay.
The secret ingredient of
my secret ingredient soup...
Ohh...
The secret ingredient is...
Nothing!
Hah?...
But you heard me.
Nothing!
There is no secret ingredient.
Wait, wait.
It's just plain old noodle soup.
You don't add some kind
of special sauce or something.
Don't have to.
To make something special...
...you just have to believe it is special.
There is no secret ingredient.
I have come home, Master.
This is no longer your home
and I am no longer your master.
Yes, you have a new favourite.
So where is this Po?
Did I scare him off?
This battle is between you and me.
So that's how it's going to be.
That is how it must be.
I rotted in jail for 20 years...
...because of your weakness!
Obeying your master is not weakness!
You knew I was the Dragon Warrior!
You always knew.
But when Oogway said otherwise...
What did you do?
What did you do!
Nothing!
You were not meant to be the Dragon Warrior.
That was not my fault!
Not your fault!
Who failed my every dream?
Who told we should train
until my bones cracked?
Who denied me my destiny?!!
It was never my decision to make!
It is now.
Give me the Scroll.
I would rather die!
What I ever did,
I did to make you proud!
Tell me how proud you are Shifu?
Tell me!
Tell meeee!
I...I have always
been proud of you.
From the first moment
I have been proud of you.
And it was my pride
that blinded me.
I love you too much
to see what you were becoming.
What I was turning you into.
I'm... I'm sorry.
I don't want your apology.
I want my Scroll.
What?
Where is it?
Dragon Warrior has taken Scroll
half way across China by now.
You will never see
that Scroll, Tai Lung!
Never!
Hey!
...Stairs.
Who are you?
Buddy...
I am the Dragon Warrior.
You?
Him?
He's a Panda.
You're a Panda.
What are you going to do, Big Guy?
Sit on me.
Don't tempt me.
Now, I'm going to use this.
You want it. Come get it.
Finally.
That Scroll is mine!
The Scroll has given him power.
Finally.
Oh yes.
The power of the Dragon Scroll
is mine!
It's nothing!
It's okay. I didn't get
it the first time either.
What?
There is no secret ingredient.
It's just you.
Stop it! Ho, ho, ho.
I'm going to pee.
Don't...don't...don't.
Ha...ha...ha...
You can't defeat me.
You...you're just a big
fat Panda!
I'm not a big fat Panda.
I'm the Big Fat Panda!
The Wushi finger hold?
Oh, you know this hold.
You're bluffing. You're bluffing!
Shifu didn't teach you that!
No, I figured it out.
Skedush...!
Ah... look!
The Dragon Warrior.
That's my boy!
The big lovely Kung Fu warrior is my son!
Yes.
Thanks Dad.
Hey guys.
Master.
Master.
Master?
Master Shifu?
Master!
Shifu! Shifu! Are you okay?
Po.
You are alive.
Or we are both dead.
No Master, I didn't die.
I defeated Tai Lung.
You did?
... Wow!
It is as Oogway foretold.
You are the Dragon Warrior.
You have brought peace
to this Valley.
And to me.
Thank you.
Thank you, Po.
Thank you. Thank you...
No, Master...
No, no, no!
Don't die Shifu, please!
I'm not dying, you idiot!
Aah... Dragon Warrior...
I'm simply at peace.
Finally.
Oh...So I should stop talking.
If you can.
Do you want to get
something to eat?
Yes


Long ago,
in ancient China.
The Peacocks rueld over Gongmen city.
They brought great joy,
and prosperity to the city.
For they have invented,
'Fireworks'.
But thier son, Lord Shen..
Saw darker power.. In the fireworks.
What had brought color and joy..
Could also bring darkness and destruction.
Shen's troubled parents consulted to Soothsayer.
She for told..
That if Shen continued,
holding his dark path..
He would be defeated by a warrior
of black and white.
The young Lord,
set out to change his fate.
But what he did next..
Only sealed it.
Shen returned to his parents,
full of pride.
But in their faces..
He saw only horror.
He was banned from the city forever.
But shen swore revenge..
Someday, he would return,
And all of China would bow at his feet.
It's almost done, Lord Shen.
But we run out of metal.
Search the farthest villages.
Find more metal!
China will be mine!
Kung-Fu Panda 2
Sub by: Ballen Abdulkarim
And then, the Dragon Warrior
joined the Furious Five!
And then they became the most
awesome Kung-Fu team ever!
Enough talk, let's fight!
Listen, listen! You can hear the
Dragon Warrior training, right now!
33..
Stop doing that.
This is too dangerous!
Look at the bottom.
Stay focused!
36..

- 37.
How is he doing that?
Look at his face!
Yes! New record!
- You monster!
- Keep going. Heat forty!
He'll never heat forty!
You got it, buddy.
I'm gonna just make it forty!
- Do it!
- No problem!
- Yeah!
- Whoo-hoo!
- Yes!
- You did it!
Will done, Po!
Oh! Master Shifu!
Gotta go. See you later!
- Whoo-hoo, yeah!
- You'll save those for me. Right?
Inner peace.
Inner.. peace.
Uhh!
Inner peace.
Master Shifu!
Master Shifu, what do we got?
Priates? Vondle to volcano mountain?
Whatever it is,
I will take them down!
'Cause I'm in a mood.
I need to get something done.
You know what I mean?
Ahh.. What you doing?
One of master Hookway's final teachings.
Wow!
Awesome!
How did you do that?
- Inner peace.
- Inner peace!
That's cool!
Inner peace of what?
It's the next face of your training.
Every master most find his path,
to inner peace.
Some chose to meditate for 50 years,
in a cave just like this!
Without the slimmest taste of food.
Or water.
Or...?
Some finds in torture and suffering.
As I did.
On the day you were
choosen as Dragon Warrior,
Was the worst day of my life.
By far.
Nothing else came close.
It was the worst most painful,
mind-destroying, horrible moment..
Okay.
I have ever experienced!
But once I realized, the problem was not you..
But with what in you.
I found inner peace.
It was able to harness
the fullthy universe.
So that's it?
I just need inner peace?
My inners are already
super-super peaceful..
So, all I need to do,
is just get this thing going.
Inner peace, you're going down!
Now show me what were you
doing that with your feet.
I saw just sort of fancy boots..
Ho! Bandits, approaching the Musician's village
Danger!
Tell those musicians to start playing
some action music, because it is on!
Don't worry, Shifu.
I'll master inner peace, as soon as I get back.
No snack stops this time!
Ha-ha-ha!
Snack stops!
Wait, you serious?
Get all the metal,
You could find!
Oh! The metal!
Help! Help! Help! Help!
That's everything!
Let's get outta here.
Reached justice!
Hmm?
The Dragon Warrior!
Panda? That's impossible!
My fist hunger for justice.
That was my.. Fist.
Get 'em!
Come on!
Take that!
It's coming!
Thank you, Mantis.
Tigress, Double Just streak!
Fetch of Fury!
Viper!
Monkey! Viper! Mantis!
Pony!
What?!
Oh, sorry!
Crane, go!
I'm on it!
Wow!
Is everyone OK?
Awesome!
I got this!
Po!
Shoo on that, Toby!
Are you Okay?
What happened?
I think I saw..
I think..
I gotta go!
Thank you!
Thank you, for coming to
Dragon Warrior Noodles and Tofu.
You wanna tea?
Lemon Sauce?
If you need anything,
just ask!
Thank you!
Uhh.. The Dragon Warrior's mop.
He might be very poor!
Don't touch it!
You'll get the mop dirty.
- He was waiting on me.
- Awesome!
Yeah! I have a stand to prove it!
Hey.. Where is the Dragon Warrior?
He doesn't work here anymore.
He is busy out there,
protecting the valley.
The Dragon Warrior!
Po!
Here.
Okay.
- He is the Dragon Warrior!
- You should've told me you're coming.
Hi, dad!
I would have get
you some stinky Tofu!
- Dad.. Can I talk to you?
- Of course, son.
Honor of my son..
Free Tofu dessert for everyone.
But with purchases.
It's so good to see you, Po!
Have you lost weight?
I could almost put my wings around you!
Ah.. Well, maybe a little.
Oh.. Poor you.
You most feel weak!
- Let me get you some soup.
- Uh.. No. That's okay, dad. I'm not hungry.
Not hungry?!
Are you alright?
Yeah, yeah.
No, I'm fine.
It's just, earlier today,
I was fighting bandits.
Nothing too dangerous..
- They were just.. You know.
- Yeah!
And then the strangest thing happened, uh..
I had this crazy vision..
I thinks I saw my mom, and me..
As a baby.
Mom?
A baby?!
Dad...
Wha.. Who.. What you..
How can I say this?
Where did I come from?
Well, you see, son..
Baby come from a little egg..
Don't ask me where the egg comes from.
Dad! It's not what I meant.
I.. I know it's not.
I think it's time I told you something,
I should've told you a long time ago.
Okay..
You.. Might have been kind of..
Adopted.
I knew it!
You knew?
- Wha.. Who told you?
- No one. I mean.. come on, dad.
But if you do,
why didn't you ever say anything?
Why didn't you say anything?
How did I get here, dad?
Where did I get from?
Actually,
You came from this..
It was just another
day at the restaurant.
Time to make the noodles.
And when I went to the back,
Where my vegetables
has just been delivered.
There were cabbages, tunas, radishes..
Only.. There was no radishes!
Just a very hungry baby-panda.
There was no note.
Ofcourse you could've eat meet.
I.. Waited for someone
to come.. Looking for you.
But no one did.
I brought you inside.
Feed you.
Give you a bath.
And feed you again!
And again.
And tried to put some pants on you.
And then I made the decision,
that would change my life forever.
To make my Secret Ingredient Soup.
And to raise you as my own son.
You, Po.
My little panda.
And from that moment on, both my soup
and my life have been that much sweeter.
That's all, Po.
That's the end of the story.
Look at me!
Oh, don't look at me!
That's it?
That can't be it!
That's gotta be more, dad!
Well, there was a time you
ate all my bamboo furniture.
It was important too.
One dumpling please.
Dragon Warrior's size.
Oh, Po! Your story may
not have such a happy beginning..
But look how it turned out!
You got me.
You got Kung-Fu.
And you got noodles!
I know! I just had so many questions.
Like how did I ever fit in this tiny basket?
Why didn't I like pants?
And, who am I?
Good.
Watch your thought.
Good!
Shen?
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Now we have got my
parents out of the way..
Please leave my house!
Your house?
Yes, Didn't you see the peacock,
in the front door?
They were so sad.
It seems your fortune is full of darkness
and not as good as you thought.
We shall see, Shen.
Ow.. You shall see a goat.
Well, well..
- What do you want, Shen?
- What is rightfully mine.
Gongmen city!
Gongmen is under the stewardship
of the masters council.
And we will protect it..
Even from you!
I'm so glad you feel that way.
Otherwise that will drag
that careful enough.
What's in the box, Shen ?
You want to see?
It's a gift!
It is your parting gift.
It mean, it will part you.
Part of you here, part of you there..
And part of you way way there..
Till you gonna hit that wall!
You insanest fool!
- Show off.
- That is a warning!
You are no match for our Kung-Fu.
I agree.
But this is!
Are you familiar with
the master of Gongmen city?
- Master thunder Rhino?
- Yes!
- Son of legendary Flying Rhino?
- Yes!
And slayer of the 10,000 Serpens's
in the valey of low!
He's dead!
Tha.. That's impossible!
Rhino's horn defend is
improvise to any technic.
It was no technic!
Lord Shen has created a weapon,
one that breeds firer and spread metal.
Unless he is stopped.
This could be
the end of Kung-Fu!
But I just got Kung-Fu!
And now, you most save it!
Go! Destroy this weapon,
and bring Lord Shen to justice.
Okay, here we go!
Here we go!
Wa-wa-wa-wa.. Wait a second.
How can I do this?
I mean, how can Kung-Fu stop
something that stops Kung-Fu?
Remember, Dragon Warrior.
Anything is possible..
When you have 'Inner peace'.
Inner peace, inner peace,
inner peace.
Peace on!
Po, Po!
I packed your stuffs.
I packed you food for week's cookies, vegetables,
and I even packed all your actions fingers.
See?
Oh! hey.. I don't know
what those are!
Never seen them before in my life.
Dad, you got scratches on my tigress.
I also packed your paintings
of our best times together.
Just in case you get lonely.
That's me and you making noodles.
And that's me and you eating noodles.
And that's me giving you
a piggy back ride.
That's cute!
I haven't second thought
about this one.
They're wating for me.
Of course, of course.
You have a job to do.
Far from home.
In a strange city, filled with strange
people and strange noodles.
Facing horrible danger, from which
you have may never return!
Don't go, Po!
I gotta go.
I'm the Dragon Warrior.
It's kind of my job to save Kung-Fu.
And if I don't,
what am I?
You are my son.
Right?
Po, It's time.
Good-bye.
Don't worry, Mr. Ping.
He'll be back before you can say 'Noodles'.
Noodles.
Come on, guys!
Let's go. Yeah!
Right.. Yeah!
Yeah, yeah.. Yeah!
Momma?
Mom? Dad? Is that you?
Mom! Dad!
Oh.. Hi! Hey-Hey..
Son, you are back.
Huh?
Honey, what you doing here?
- But I thought..
- We replaced you, dear. with a lovely radish.
- Radish?!
- It's quite, polite, and frankly..
It does better Kung-Fu.
No.. No, no, no!
Wait!
Radish, radish, radish!
Inner pea..
pea..
Inner peace.
Inner peace, inner peace, inner peace...
I'm.. Training.
The mast, is not the worthy opponent.
I'm ready.
Okay..
So series!
I think I prefer the mast.
Apologize.
I used to punch the iron wood
trees by the fist in training.
Now, I feel nothing.
That's severely cool!
Again!
So.. This punching iron wood trees,
how long did you have to do that?
- 20 years.
- Oh.. 20.. 20 years!
Is there any.. Uhh.. You know,
faster way.. You know..
Until.. You know..
Don't feel anything?
No!
Besides,
I don't think, hard
style is your thing.
Po..
Why are you really out here?
I just found out, that my dad..
Isn't really my dad.
Your dad,
the goose..
Most have been quite a shock!
Yeah!
And this bothers you?
Are you kidding me?
We're warriors, right?
Nerve's of steel, soul's of Platinum.
Like you.
So hard core, you don't feel anything!
- I was..
- So, what you guys talking about?
Nothing.. Nothing!
Po's having daddy's issues.
I'm so lucky, I dont have
any problem with my dad.
'Cause my mother ate his head,
before I was born.
I don't know!
Mantis, this isn't about you!
Po, is the one freaking out.
I'm not freaking out.
Po..
I'm freaking in.
- Po!
- What?
We're here.
Gongmen city!
My father's throne.
He used to let me play here,
beside him.
Promising with someday
this throne would be mine.
A little to the left.
But it's so heavy, Master.
Every thing, most be
exactly how I visioned it.
And I have visioned it
a little to the left.
Perfect!
With the weapon, by my side..
A little bit more.
With the weapon, by my side,
all China will bow before me!
We move out in 3 days,
when the moon is full.
And the tide is high.
You're down, you old goat,
why don't you tell me my..
Fortune?
The future. I was going to say 'Future'.
Look in to your bowl,
and tell me what glorious waits.
If you continue on your current path,
You will find yourself..
At the bottom of the stairs.
I see...
I see...
I see, pain and anger!
How dare you?
That is the finest suit in the province!
Followed by denial.
This is not fortune telling.
- Now just say what's happening right..
- Now?
The most important time is now.
But if you really want
to see the future.
What do you see?
A peacock..
Is defeated by a warrior,
of black and white.
Nothing has chainged!
That's impossible.
And you know it.
It is not impossible,
and he knows it.
Who?
Lord Shen!
I saw a panda.
A panda!
A Kunf-Fu warrior.
It fought like a demon!
Big and fury.
Soft and squishy.
Kind of clashing and cuddly.
There are no more pandas.
Even with his poor eye sight,
he can see the truth.
Why?
Is it that you can not?
Find this panda,
and bring him to me!
Yes, sir!
One panda lives,
that will not make you right
You are right.
Beeing right makes me right!
Then, I will kill him.
And make you wrong.
Would you stop that?
That must be Shen's palace,
in the other side of the city.
Great! We will match in the tower, and proclaim;
We are the Dragon Warrior
and the Furious Five,
And we are here to bring you to justice!
What are you doing?
This place is crowling with wolves.
Hey! Isn't that the guy that
hammered you in the face?
I do not like that guy!
We need to get to that to tower,
without being spoted by those wolves.
Got it..
Stealth Mode!
That noodles!
Ow!
Hello!
Yeah, okay.. Anyway.
Where was I?
- Where is, Po?
- How can we lose a guy that big?
Guys, guys?
- He-Hey, Po!
- Sorry!
So, that was Stealth Mode, Huh?
Let's be honest,
not one of my stronger modes.
We now there is more gold in there.
Come on!
- This rice is raw!
- You stole of my metal pots for Lord Shen!
Either you cook my rice..
Or I cook you.
Po, do something!
How am I suppose to help the
cook-rice, while I'll get caught?
- Wait.. I have a better idea!
- Three, Two, One!
- Hey!
- Hey!
We're here to liberate the city,
and bring Shen to justice.
You will need help!
Thank you brave sheep,
but it's too dangerous..
I can't let you.
Oh.. No, not me.
It's not safe to speak you.
Right!
I'm talking about, Masters Ox and Croc!
They are in Gongmen Jail,
at Black Dragon area.
What?
They're still alive?!
They must be in that jail..
Gathering intelligents hatching a plot to use
their awesomeness to defeat the weapon.
Okay, let's go!
Thank you, sheep.
Hey!
Stop that costume!
Uhh.. Sorry!
Take.. That!
- Keep running!
- Faster!
Now!
Got you!
Huh?
Where did they go?
Split up!
Search every where!
What about over there?
Is 'there' a part of every where?
I.. I guess.
Then search there!
The most be close.
I can feel a Kung-Fu chill,
riding up by my side!
Sorry, Po.
It's just me!
Look!
'Gongmen Jail'!
Oh.. It's cute.
Cute? Huh?
Nice work, Po.
At the first sight of trouble,
I'll give you a signal.
Gaga-Gagy!
- You mean like Crane does?
- Yeah!
Excuse me!
When have I ever, made that noise?
Master Ox!
Master..
Master Croc!
Hey.. Master storming, Ox!
I can't belive, I'm rescuing
actula legends of Kung-Fu.
No, they wouldn't leave
a key around here.
Oh, good.. You found it!
Come on you guys. Yeah!
We're coming for you, Shen!
Guys, are we going or not?
Do you wanna do this later? I mean,
you do wanna take back you city. Right?
Of course, we do.
But if we stand up against Shen,
he will turn the weapon on the city!
Listen to your self.
You're protecting Gongmen city,
by not protecting Gongmen city?
If we all fight together..
Then the weapon would kill, everyone.
Oh, would it?
Then we use, a sneak attack.
- We'll get inside, and then...
- And then you'll be stopped!
By the unstoppable weapon.
No thing is unstoppable.
Except for me. When I'm stopping you
from telling me something unstoppable.
Master Ox,
I'm not let you stay in this cell!
Then let's just see
how you get me out!
You guys see that?
It's called beeing awesome!
Come on! what ever
happen to be a hero?
The only hero in this town,
is the dead one.
Like I said; You are not
getting me outta this cell!
Yes!
Alright. Let's go!
I get the top bunk.
It's time to surrender, panda.
Kung-Fu is dead!
I..
You.. You.. Kung-Fu is a dea..aa.ad!
Fine!
You stay in your prison of fear!
With bars made of hopelessnest.
And all you get is 3 square
meals a day of... Shame.
With disparateful dessert.
We'll take on Shen.
And prove to all those
who hunger for justice!
And honor, 'The Kung-Fu still lives'.
Yeah!
Monkey!
Gaga!
You.. You're mine!
I'll tell you what's gonna be yours..
My fist and those guards deadly
punch, to your super-sole face!
Uh-ouh!
Get him!
- Get me outta here!
- Yes, sir!
- Stop him!
- Yeah!
- Lose him!
- Yes, sir!
Hang on!
Watch out!
Try this, fool!
Sure, I did!
Maybe something small.
Oh, no!
You better get off from me!
- Higher!
- Higher!
We lost them.
Again!
Crane, catch!
Guys, guys, guys.. give me a shot.
Mantis, now!
Is that all you got? Because I fell
it like a beetles filthy fight!
This glad is about to put under thunder!
Why there are.. so.. many.. stars?
Come here!
I like to squash..
Yes!
Taste of the defeat.
Let me tell you something..
Next time you miss with a panda,
you better bring a whole...
Guess no body told you;
If you miss with a wolve..
You'll get the fangs.
I hit you twice..
what are you gonna do now?
We surrender!
You could chain my body but you will
never chain my.. warrior spirit.
- They don't forget the little guy!
- Did you just called me..
Po, what're you doing?
Trust me, I gotta a... pla..ww!
No way!
Eight point akupressur cuffs!
Just like the one that held Tailong, the
more you move the tier they get..
These are the best cuffs.
Greetings, panda.
At last we meet.
No. No, no, no..
We meet at last!
Yes!
That's it!
Greetings, panda.
We meet at..
You are afraid for a reason.
I'm not afraid.
He's coming to me in chains.
Have anyone should be afraid?
You!
Don't you, little sick goat!
I hope this turns out
better than you planned to..
Cup rice in your stomache by eating
raw and dreanking boiling watter.
This plan's nothing like that plan.
This is one's gonna work!
Keep moving.
Ah... My old enemy!
Stairs!
Thanks for carying me.
This is the last of my claim..
Okay.
I threw up a little bit on the third floor,
Someone might wanna clean that up.
There's some sort of evil janitor, or something.
Greetings, panda.
We meet at..
Hi. How you doing?
Hey...
You've grown up
bigger than I thought.
Hey, okay.
I have enough food.
Strong.
Healthy.
Look, I don't know who you are.
But please stand a side, sir.
That's a lady!
Oh.. Sorry!
The beard through me,
it's kind of miss leading.
False every time.
Enough of this!
Bring the prisoners to me.
Sorry ma'am. Get ready guys,
keep your eyes held for the..
Weapon!
We did it! I just Kung-Fued it.
Did you guys see that?
I was all like..
Waao!
How do you actually believe,
this is the warrior destined to defeat me?
I do not!
I know he is.
Look at him!
A life time to plan his revenge,
then he comes to be on his knee.
A life time.. Wo-wo-wo!
I did not have a life time.
We only heard about
master Rhino a few days ago,
And we've came to revenge him!
You've come to revange,
nothing else?
Well, Yeah. All the pots and pants
that you stole, I want those back.
Nothing else?
You probaly did some evil step, for long away.
I don't know..
What else did you do?
- You don't know?!
- Know what?
What's so funny?
Very thing!
Did you clearly do not know?
Okay, enough for these readls!
Would you guys spell the bins?
First we know, we came in and
the weapon is tiny.. surprise, it's big!
And then, lady over here,
I think it's a guy, he's gotta be..
The only reason you're still alive,
Is that, I found your stupidity, mildly amusing.
Well, thank you. But I found your
evilness extremely annoying!
Who do you think you are, panda?
Who do you think am I, peacock?
Why are we laughing?
Take him.
Fire!
Can you light that... thing?
Here the bug!
Get the weapon!
Tigress!
- You.. You were there.
- Yes.. Yes, I was!
You just let Shen, get away.
We destroyed the weapon!
Fire!
Uh.. No!
He's got a way more.
Wow!
My wings!
- Help, Po!
- Coming!
Watch out!
Po!
- Help me up!
- No. Get him down.
Use the ropes.
Run, run.. Little panda!
Help, come on!
We need you to focus.
I've got it, I've got it!
Bring 'em down!
- We trapped!
- This way.
Good bye!
Fire!
Get back!
Lonely way out, is up.
What?
Follow me.
Come on!
Where are they going?
To the top!
Come on, peacock!
You'll be down!
You idiot!
My nose!
Call in the wolves.. All of them!
I want them ready to move!
The year of the peacock,
begins now!
Right now?
'Cause it's the middle of the year.
So you don't only get, like a
half of the year of peacock.
And this is the year,
of course, of the peacock.
Happy new year, sir!
Get the wolves ready!
We're loading the ships, now.
Now!
Now, now, now...!
This way.
Go!
Oh.. You!
What did you do?
It's chaos up there.
What happened to stopping Shen?
Yeah..
Guys, come on!
Give me a little credit.
I meant for him, to get away.
'Cause.. It's a trick.
There's a lot!
I was thinking, of..
figure out his plan.. more.
That makes, no sense.
What you mean?
What you mean? It sure does.
Po, the truth!
You had Shen.
What happened?
What're you talking about? What're you..
I don't know, what are you talking about?
Uh.. Yeah!
Ahh.. You got me of course.
The truth!
Fine!
They'll keep you far from danger.
Realist far!
What?
You're staying here.
Wa.. Wait!
I have to go back..
You are staying here.
I'm going.
And you can't stop me!
Okay, I wasn't ready that time.
Guys, don't!
Ready!
Look!
Stay down!
I have to get to him.
Then, tell me why.
He was there.
Okay?
The peacock was there,
the last time I saw my parents.
He knows what happened.
Where I came from.
Who I am.
Look, I'm going.
I have to know.
The hard core can't understand.
Tigress.. No!
The hard core do understand.
But I can't watch my friend,
be killed.
We're going.
Hey!
Maybe you can't watch me be killed.
Stop it one wing.
And.. She's back!
Don't worry, kid.
We better all here.
You were wrong, Soothsayer.
We sail to victory tonight.
Your magic panda is clearly a fool.
I'm certain it's the panda who is a fool
You just destroyed your ancestor home Shen.
I'll trivial the sacrifice,
When all of the China
is my reward!
Then will you finaly be satisfied..
While the subduction of the whole
world, finaly make you feel better.
Hmm.. This is not.
I'll mightily sacrifice
them in the dungeon.
The coup you choose to fill,
has no bottom.
It's time to stop this madness!
Why on Earth would I do that?
So your parents
can rest in peace.
My parents..
Hated me!
Do you understand?
They wronged to me.
And then..
I.. Will make it right.
They loved you..
They loved you so much, that
having to send you away kill them.
The dead exist in the past.
And I must attend to the future.
Set the Soothsayer free.
She is not a use to me.
Good bye, Shen.
I wish you happiness.
Happiness, most be taken.
And I will take mine.
Hurry it up!
If all those weapons
leave the building..
China will fall.
- We'll bring down the building.
- I got it!
How about this?
That's will work!
- Alright, let's go.
- I can't feel my face!
Damn what you call Peacock!
Hey!
Hey.
You guys keep it cool, cool, cool.
You!
Where you going?
On your feet!
And whipe those stupid
careens on your faces!
Move, you dogs!
Faster, faster!
Load the boat.
Greetings, panda!
Tell me what happened that night?
What night?
That night!
Ahh.. That night.
Yes.
Yes, I was there.
Yes, I watched your
parents abandoned you.
It's a terrible thing.
I believe, it was something like.. This!
Hope you like it.
'Cause you can't return it!
Po? What's he doing there?
Return it! Return it!
Now you willing to die,
to find the truth.
You bet I am.
Of all I..
For or for not to.
We got them, Go!
Looking for me?
I said that too soon,
Didn't I?
Po!
Po, get away from him!
No more running, Shen.
So it seems.
Now..
Answers!
Oh, You want to know so badly.
You think knowing it will heal you?
Huh?
Fill some crater in your soul.
Well, here's you answer..
Your parents, didn't love you.
But here.. Let me heal you.
No!
Yeah, like you can make me drink that...
If I wanted you dead,
I would have left you in that river.
Why do you save me?
So you can full-fill your destiny.
What're you talking about?
Where am I?
What's this place?
I'm surprised you remember so little.
But.. You were so little,
when it happened.
Perhaps you do remember.
Now what?
It's just a stupid nightmare.
Nightmare..
Or memory?
Stop hiding!
This was a striving vilage.
Young Shen was in line
to rule Gongmen city.
But he wanted more.
I foretold that someone
will stand in his way.
A panda!
But I never could've foretold,
what came next.
Kill them all!
Pick our son.
And run away!
Go!
Stop fighting!
Let it flow.
Your story may not have
such a happy beginning.
But, that doesn't make you who you are.
It's the rest of your story.
Who you choose to be.
So..
Who are you, panda?
I am Po.
And I'm gonna need a hat.
But now it's a time only for joy.
You are going to be part
of something, beautiful!
Once we reach the harbor
In front of whole the world..
You and your precious Kung-Fu, will die!
And China, will nod and bowed before me.
Set sail!
Honesty guys, I never
thought I'll die like this.
I was thought I'll meet a nice girl,
and settle down, and..
And she'll it my head.
So sad!
We can not give up hope.
Po would warn us to remain strong.
Hard core. Right?
Tigress?
Lord Shen,
what about the bridge?
Nothing stands on my way.
Fire!
You coward!
Po?
- Po?
- Po?
How many times, do I have to
kill this same stinky panda?
Shen!
A panda, stands between you and your destiny!
What?
Prepare yourself for a hot server of justice.
That will bring Shen to the end!
What?
And now, free the Five!
Disk of destruction!
Okay..
Take him!
Ready?
This way and that way.
That way and this way.
Yes.
You can't follow me!
Just, get him!
Yeah.. Ha..
Here we go.
- No, no, no.. Don't shoot!
- Don't shoot!
- Don't shoot!
- Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
Don't...
- Yeah!
- Don't shoot!
Crossfire!
Attack!
Capture of freedom!
Monkey!
Impressive, Dragon Warrior.
What's your plan?
Step 1: Free the Five.
What's step 2?
Honestly, I didn't think
I'd make it this far.
Po!
Stop Shen,
before he gets to the harbour.
Hoo-hoo!
Nice!
Viper, Puppet of Death.
Tigress!
Master Ox!
And Croc!
Vengeance is served.
- Why did you..?
- Your friend there..
Is very persuasive.
Mr. Shifu!
Quickly! Use their
boats to block the way.
Crane!
Wings of Justice!
Ca-ca!
What?
I love you guys!
Why aren't we firing?
They're taken out our guns, sir.
They're getting close!
Fire, fire at what are in there all!
But sir, they're your own.
I said; Fire and fire!
No!
Po!
Tigress?
As you wish..
Let's finish this!
Fire!
Inner peace.
Inner peace.
Again!
Yeah!
Hoo!
Kill him!
Somebody, kill him!
What?
No!
Keep firing.
Keep firing!
How did you..
How did you do it?
You know, you just
keep your elbows up,
- And keep your shoulder loose.
- Not that! How did you found peace?
I took away your parents!
Everything!
I scared you for life.
See? That's the thing, Shen..
Scars heal.
No, they don't.
Wounds heal.
Oh, yeah!
What does scar do?
They fade, I guess?
I don't care what scars do.
You should, Shen.
You've gotta let go that stuff in the past.
'Cause, it's just doesn't matter!
The only thing that matters,
is what you choose to be now.
You're right.
Then, I choose..
This!
That.. Was pretty hard core.
Po! You're here!
Don't ever do that again, please?
It seems you have found,
Inner Peace.
That's such a young age!
Well, I had a pretty good teacher.
What do you mean, he's not here?
It's my son's birthday!
All he wanted, was to meet
the Dragon Warrior!
How about some tofu
birthday cake, instead. Huh?
You know?
I think we'll just try again, another time.
When do you think he will be back?
I don't know!
Okay? I don't know!
Maybe, never!
I'm worried. Okay?
But, that's my job.
I'm his dad! I mean..
I was his dad.
Why did he had to go
and save Chaina?
I know why..
But why?
This is one little panda!
So, how did it go?
Did you saved China?
Yep.
Well.. I knew you could.
That's why I have new signs made.
My son saved China.
You two can save, by one
dumpling with one free!
Hey.. That's a pretty good deal!
Would you like to try one?
Maybe later.
There's something,
I should tell you.
While I was gone..
I found the village where I was born.
I found out, how I ended
up, in that radish basket.
You did?
I know who I am.
You do?
I'm your son!
Oh..
I love you, dad.
I love you too, son!
Delicious fat radishes.
You probably hungry.
Let me cook something for you.
What're you talking about?
I'll cook.
No, no.
I'll cook.
Dad?!
It's the least I can do.
You saved China!
No.. It's the least I can do.
You raised me!
- Po?
- Dad?
Po!
Okay!
Let's both cook.
- Together.
- Together.
No. I'll cook!

All right,
Mr Bile, is it?
Uh... my friends
call me Phlegm.
Uh-huh.
Mr Bile, can you tell me
what you did wrong?
I fell down?
No, no, before that.
Can anyone tell me
Mr Bile's big mistake?
Anyone?
( coughs )
( groans )
Let's take a look
at the tape.
Here we go.
Uh, right...
puh-puh-puh-puh...
Ah! There, see?
The door.
You left it wide open.
( whiopers )
( all ourouring )
And leaving the door open
is the worst mistake
any employee
can make because...?
Um... it could let in a draft?
It could let in
a child!
Oh! Mr Waternoose!
There is nothing more toxic
or deadly than a human child.
A single touch could kill you!
Leave a door open
and a child could walk
right into this factory!
Right into the monster world!
I won't go
in a kid's room!
You can't make me!
You're going in there
because we need this.
( children screaoing )
( whiopering )
( static and feedback )
( screaoing stops )
Our city is counting on you
to collect
those children's screams.
Without scream,
we have no power.
Yes, it's dangerous work
and that's why I need
you to be at your best.
I need scarers
who are confident, tenacious
tough, intimidating.
I need scarers like... like...
James P. Sullivan.
( snoring )
Hey! Good morning,
Monstropolis.
It's now five after
the hour of 6:00 a.m.
in the big monster city.
Temperature's a
balmy 65 degrees--
which is good news
for you reptiles--
and it looks like it's
going to be a perfect day
to maybe, hey,
just lie in bed, sleep in
or simply... work out that flab
that's hanging over the bed!
Get up, Sulley!
-( honking )
-( screaoing )
I don't believe I ordered
a wake-up call, Mikey.
Hey! Less talk, more pain,
marshmallow boy!
-( growling )
-Feel the burn!
You call yourself
a monster?
( growling )
Scary feet, scary feet,
scary feet!
Oop! The kid's awake!
Okay, scary feet, scary feet,
scary feet, scary feet--
Kid's asleep!
( roaring )
Twins! In a bunk bed!
( growling )
Ooh! I thought I had you there.
Okay, Sulley, here we go.
You ready? Follow it.
Oh! It's over here!
Oh, look over there!
Don't let the kid
touch you!
Don't let it touch you!
I don't know,
but it's been said
I love scaring kids in bed!
Come on, fight that plaque!
Fight that plaque!
Scary monsters
don't have plaque!
Do I see 1 20?
Oh, I don't believe it!
I'm not even
breaking a sweat.
Not you!
Look! The new
commercial's on!

We know the challenge--

Human kids are harder to scare.
Of course, M.I. is prepared

We scare because we care.
I can't believe it.
Oh, Mike...
I was on TV!
Did you see me?
I'm a natural!
( phone rings )
Hello.
I know!
Hey, wasn't I great?
Did the whole
family see it?
It's your mom.
What can I say?
The camera loves me.
( bicycle bell rings )
I'm telling you, big daddy
you're going to be seeing
this face on TV a lot more often.
~Yeah? Like, on
Monstropolis's Most Wanted?
( oocking laughter )
You've been jealous
of my good looks
since the
fourth grade, pal.
Have a good day, sweetie.
You, too, hon.
Whoo!
Okay, Sulley, hop on in.
Nope. Uh-uh. Uh-uh.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Where you going?
What are you doing?
Mikey, there's a scream shortage.
We're walking.
Walking?! Yep.
No, no, no, my baby.
Come on. Come on.
Look, she needs
to be driven.
Bye, baby.
I... I'll call you!
MIKE:
Hey, genius,
you want to know why
I bought the car? Huh?
Not really.
To drive it!
You know, like,
on the street?
With the honk-honk
and the vroom-vroom
and no walking involved.
( oock whining )
Give it a rest,
will you, butterball?
Come on, you could
use the exercise.
I could use
the exercise?!
Look at you.
You have your own climate!
GIRL MONSTERS:

Hey! Morning, kids.

Pow, pow,

I hear somebody's

Ah, just trying
to make sure
there's enough scream
to go around.
( laughing )
Hey! On the house!
-Hey, thanks!
-Grazie!
MIKE:
Ba-da-bing!
( startled gasp )
Oh, great.
Hey, Ted!
Good morning!

leaning to the left.
It is not!
Hey, fellas.
Hey,Jerry.
Hey, Mr Sullivan!
Guys, I told you,
call me Sulley.
( nervous giggling )
I don't think so.
We just wanted to wish
you good luck today.
Hey. Hey, hey,
hey, hey!
Come on, get lost,
you two.
You're making him
lose his focus.
Oh. Sorry.
See you later,
fellas.
Go get 'em,
Mr Sullivan!
Quiet! You'll make
him lose his focus.
Oh, no. Sorry!
Shut up!
-( phones ringing )
-Monsters, Inc. Please hold.

I'll connect you.
Ms Fearmonger is on vacation.
Would you like her voice mail?
Oh, Schmoopsie-poo.

Happy birthday.
Oh, Googley-woogley,

Hey, Sulley-wulley.
Oh, hey, Celia...
weelia.
( clears throat ):
Happy birthday.
Thanks.
So, uh... are we going
anywhere special tonight?
I just got us
into a little place
called, um...
Harryhausen's.
( gasps )
Harryhausen's?!
But it's impossible to
get a reservation there!
Not for Googley Bear.
I will see you
at quitting time
and not a minute later.
Okay, sweetheart.
Think romantical
thoughts.
You and me
Me and you
Both of us together!
You know, pal, she's the one.
That's it.
She is the one!
I'm happy for you.
Oh, and, uh,
thanks for hooking me up
with those reservations.
Oh, no problem.
They're under the
name Googley Bear.
Oh, good ide...
You know,
that wasn't very funny.
( gasps )
What the...?
Wazowski!
( screaos )
( grunts )
( chuckling )
What do you know?
It scares little kids
and little monsters.
I wasn't scared.
I have... allergies.
( coughing )
Uh-huh. Sure.
Hey, Randall, save it for
the scare floor, will you?
I'm in the zone today,
Sullivan.
Going to be doing
some serious scaring.
Putting up some big numbers.
Wow, Randall.
That's great.
That should make it
even more humiliating
when we break the record first.
Ha, ha!
Shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh.
Do you hear that?
It's the winds of change.
( oocking voice ):
''You hear it?
You hear the winds of ch...?''
Oh, what a creep.
One of these days,
I am really...
going to let you
teach that guy a lesson.
( deep croaking )
( liquid squishing )
Chalooby! Baby!
MIKE:
Good morning, Roz
my succulent
little garden snail.
And who would
we be scaring today?
Wazowski, you didn't file
your paperwork last night.
Oh, that darn paperwork.
Wouldn't it be easier
if it all just blew away?
( chair squeaking )
Don't let it happen again.
Yes, well, I'll, uh...
I'll try to be less careless.
I'm watching you, Wazowski.
Always watching.
Whoo! She's nuts.
Always!
CELIA ( over P.A. ):
All scare floors are now active.
Assistants, please report

Oh, I'm feeling
good today, Mikey!
Yeah!

Attaboy.
Another door coming right up.
( whirring and clanking )
( child screaoing )
( bell dings )

You're still behind,

You know, maybe I should
realign the scream intake valve.
Just get me
another door!
A door! Yes, door!

( children screaoing )
Well,Jerry, what's
the damage so far?
We may actually
make our quota today, sir.
Hmm. First time
in a month.
( gurgling and burping )
Huh?!
( door buzzing )
( screaoing and sobbing )
What happened?
The kid almost
touched me!
She got this close
to me!
She wasn't
scared of you?
She was only six!
I could've been dead!
I could've died!
Keep it together, man.
( whistling )
Hey! We got a dead
door over here!
-We're coming!
-Coming!
-Look out!
-Out of the way!
-Coming through!
-Excuse us.
( whiopering )
We've lost 58 doors
this week, sir.
Oh, kids these days.
They just don't get
scared like they used to.
Let her rip!
( buzzing )
( oetallic clank )
( eerie blubbering )
( child screaoing )
( bell dings )
Uh, sir?
What?!
Look.
CELIA ( over P.A. ):
Attention.
We have a new scare leader:
Randall Boggs.
( snickering )
( assistants cheering )
( children screaoing )
( knuckles cracking )
Slumber party.
( laughing )
Whoo!
( beeping )
CELIA ( over P.A. ):
Never mind.
Hey! Watch it!
( Sulley laughing )
Well,James, that was
an impressive display!
Oh, just doing my job,
Mr Waternoose.
Of course, I did
learn from the best.
( both laughing )
If I don't see a new door at
my station in five seconds
I will personally
put you through the shredder!
( screaos )
Hey, Wazowski, nice job!
Those numbers
are pretty sweet.
Are they?
You know,
I hadn't even noticed.
And, uh...
how is Georgie doing?
He's doing great!
I love working
with that big guy.
( child screaoing )
Keep the doors coming,
Charlie.
I'm on a roll today.
George and I
are like brothers.
( gasping )
( gasping )
( alaro blaring )
COMPUTER VOICE ( over P.A. ):
Red alert! Red alert!
Red alert! Red alert! Red alert!
FEMALE ( over P.A. ):
George Sanderson
please remain motionless.
Prepare for decontamination.
Get it off!
JERRY:
Duck and cover, people!
Oh, not the CD A.
( siren wailing )
CD A AGENT:
Move! Move! Move!
Coming through, please.
Stand aside.
CD A AGENT 2:
Clear the contaminated area.
( screaos )
CD A AGENT:
This is a 231 9 in progress.
Keep the area clear.
Coming through.
Watch yourself.
( grunts )
( whiopering )
Stand back.
Careful.
( oetallic clang )
( drills whirring )
( all gasping )
( ouffled explosion )
( drills whirring )
All clear.
Situation is niner-niner-zero.
Ready for decon.
Hey, thanks, guys.
That was a close one.
Okay.
( shears buzzing )
( screaoing )
( whiopering )
( ripping )
( screaoing )
JERRY:
Okay, people, take a break!
We got to shut down
for a half-hour
and reset the system.
An entire scare floor
out of commission.
What else can go wrong?
Oh... what a day.
We're just going through
a rough time, sir.
Everyone knows you're going
to get us through it.
Tell that to the
board of directors.
( slurping )
James, this company
has been in my family
for three generations.
I would do anything to
keep it from going under.
Oh, so would I, sir.
Well...
Say, I could use your help
with something.
Anything, sir.
You see, we've hired
some new scare recruits
and frankly, they're...
they're, um... uh...
Inexperienced?
Oh, they stink!
Uh-huh.
And I thought maybe
you might come by tomorrow
and give them a demonstration.
Show them what it takes
to be a top scarer, huh?
I'll start out with the old
Waternoose jump-and-growl.
( growling loudly )
Ha! Oh, oh, yes!
Now, that's my boy!
( both laughing )
( ringing )
JERRY:
Let's go, everybody!
All doors must be returned!
No exceptions!
-Whoo!
-Oh, yeah.
I've never seen anything
like you today.
You were on
a roll, my man.
Another day like this
and that scare record's
in the bag.
That's right, baby!
Uh-huh.
So get this--
as if dinner wasn't enough
I'm taking her to
a monster truck rally afterwards.
Nice.
What's on your agenda?
I'm going to head home
and work out some more.
Again? You know, there's
more to life than scaring.
( sniffing )
Whew. Hey, can I
borrow your odorant?
Yeah. I got, uh...
smelly garbage or old dumpster.
You got low tide?
No.
How about wet dog?
Yep. Stink it up.
( growling )
You know, I am so romantic
sometimes I think
I should just marry myself.
Give me a break,
Mike.
What a night of romance
I got ahead of me.
Tonight is about me
and Celia.
Ooh, the love boat
is about to set sail.
( ioitating ship horn )
'Cause I got
to tell you, buddy
that face of hers,
it just makes my heart go...
Yikes!
Hello, Wazowski.
Fun-filled evening
planned for tonight?
Well, as a
matter of fact...
Then I'm sure you
filed your paperwork
correctly... for once.
Your stunned silence
is very reassuring.
Oh, no. My scare reports--
I left them on my desk
and if I'm not at
the restaurant in five minutes
they're going to give
our table away!
What am I going to tell...
Schmoopsie-poo.
Hey, Googley Bear.
Want to get going?
Do I ever!
It's just that...
What?
Uh, you know,
there's a small....
I don't understand.
It's just that I forgot
about some paperwork
I was supposed to file.
Mike was reminding me.
Thanks, buddy.
Whoo.
I was? I mean, I was!
Yeah, I was.
Oh, okay.
Let's go then.
We're going!
On my desk, Sulley.
The pink copies
go to Accounting
the fuchsia ones
go to Purchasing
and goldenrod ones
go to Roz.
Huh!
Leave the puce.
SULLEY:
Pink copies go to Accounting,
the fuchsia ones go to Roz.
No, fuchsia ones
go to Purchasing.
The goldenrod ones go to Roz.
Man, I have no idea
what puce is.
Oh, that's puce.
Hmm?
Uh, hello?
Anyone?
There's a door here.
Hmm.
( door latch clicking )
( door creaking )
( whispering ):
Hello?
Hey.
Psst.
Anybody scaring in here?
Hello?
Yo!
Hmm.
( thuop )
( thuop )
( thuop )
( speaking baby talk )
( screaos )
Whoa! Ah! Ah!
Oh!
( giggling ):
Here.
Gotcha!
( yells )
( squeals in delight )
Eh!
( giggling )

Oh!

Yeow!

Eww.
( toy ducks quacking )

Whew.
( Sulley screaos )

Kitty!

No, no-- stay back.

PHOTOGRAPHER:
Hold it. Hold it.
( shutter clicks )
ALL:
Get a paper bag!
Mmm.
( laughing )
Oh, Michael, I've had
a lot of birthday...
well, not a
lot of birthdays
but this is the
best birthday ever.
Hmm.
What are you
looking at?
I was just thinking
about the first time
I laid eye on you--
how pretty you looked.
Stop it!
Your hair was
shorter then.
Mm-hmm. I'm thinking
about getting it cut.
( faint squeal of fear )
No, no, I like
it this length.
( sighs of relief )
I like everything
about you.
Just the other day
someone asked me
who I thought
the most beautiful monster was
in all of Monstropolis.
You know what I said?
What did you say?
I said...
Sulley?
Sulley?
No! No, no.
That's not
what I was going to say.
Mike, you're not making sense.
SULLEY:
Hi, guys!
What a coincidence,
running into you here!
Uh, I'm just going
to order something to go.
Michael...
Sulley!
I wonder what's good here.
Get out of here.
You're ruining everything.
I went back to get
your paperwork
and there was a door.
What?
( rattling )
A door?!
Randall was in it.
Wait a minute.
Randall?
That cheater!
He's trying
to boost his numbers!
There's something else.
What?!
Ook-lay in the ag-bay.
What?!
Look in the bag.
What bag?
( sighs )
( gasps )
( giggling )
Oh!
They don't have
anything I like here.
So take care, Celia!
Excuse me, sir.
What's going on?
Celia, please try
to understand.
I have to do something!
Michael?
PHOTOGRAPHER:
On three.
One... two....
( squeals and giggles )
( screaoing )
A kid!
Boo!
( all screaoing )
A kid!
There's a kid here--
a human kid!
( exclaioing in baby talk )
Oh!
CELIA:
Googley Bear!
( yelling )
( blows raspberry )
Come on!
( oonsters screaoing in terror )
MIKE:
Let's get out of here!
CD A HELICOPTER PILOT:
Please remain calm.
This is not a drill.
( siren wailing,
~ tyres screeching )
CD A AGENT:
We have an 835 in progress.
Please advise.
Michael? Michael?
Oh, Celia.
-Please come with me.
-Ow. Stop pushing.
Hey, get your hands off
my Schmoopsie-poo!
Building clear.
Ready for decontamination.
Well, I don't think that date
could have gone any worse.
( explosion )
( electrical buzzing )
If witnesses are to be believed
there has been
a child security breach
for the first time
in monster history.
We can neither confirm nor deny
the presence of
a human child here tonight.
Well, a kid flew right over me
and blasted a car
with its laser vision!
I tried to run from it,
but it picked me up
with its mind powers
and shook me like a doll!
It's true!
I saw the whole thing!
It is my
professional opinion
that now is the time
to... panic!
Oh-oh.
( both yelling )
Oh, it's coming!
It's coming!
( giggling ):
Boo!
( both screaoing )
( distant sirens wailing )
( delighted cry )
( yelling )
No, no, no, no, no!
Come here, kid.
Whee.
No, don't touch those,
you little...!
Oh, now
those were alphabetized.
It's okay, it's all right.
As long as it doesn't
come near us
we're going to be okay.
( sneezes )
( screaos )
( yelling in pain )
( whiopering in fear )
Wanna ride on it!
Da, da-da.
Da-da-da.
Oh, y-you like this?
Fetch!
( giggles )
( gasps )
Hey, hey, that's it!
No one touches
little Mikey!
( whining )
Mike, give her the bear.
Oh, no.
( piercing screao )
( electrical buzzing )
( screaoing and crying
~ continue )
( buzzing continues )
( exclaioing in fear )
Make it stop, Sulley!
Make it stop!
Look!
See the bear?
Ooh, nice bear.
( screaos )
Sulley!
See?
Ooh, bear, ooh.
Oh, he's
a happy bear.
He's not crying,
neither should you
Or we'll be in trouble
'Cause they're gonna find us
So please stop crying
Right now.
Good, good, Sulley.
Keep it up.
You're doing great.
Ooh, the happy bear,
he has no...
( screaoing )
She touched me!
Sulley, the bear!
The bear!
Give her the...
Whoa!
( giggles )
( screaoing with laughter )
( electrical buzzing
~ grows louder )
( light bulb shatters )
( giggles )
What was that?
( thuoping )
I have no idea
but it would be
really great
if it didn't
do it again.
( giggles )
Shh, shh, shh.
Shh...
Shh.
Shh...
Ah!
How could I do this?
How could I be so stupid?
This could destroy
the company.
The company?
Who cares
about the company?!
What about us?
That thing is
a killing machine!
La-la-la-la-la-la
I bet it's just waiting
for us to fall asleep
and then wham!
Oh, we're easy prey,
my friend-- easy prey.
We're sitting targets.
Okay, look, I think
I have a plan here.
Using mainly spoons, we dig
a tunnel under the city
and release it into the wild.
Spoons.
That's it, I'm out of ideas.
We're closed.
Hot air balloon?
Too expensive.
Giant slingshot?
Too conspicuous.
Enormous wooden horse?
Too Greek!
( speaking baby talk )
No plan. No plan.
Can't think.
Can't think.
Flatlining.
Uh, Mike?
I think she's getting tired.
Well, then
why don't you
find someplace
for it to sleep?
While I think of a plan!
Are you sleepy?
You want to sleep?
Is that what you want?
Huh?
( crunching )
Okay, all right.
I'm making a nice
little area for you to...
( giggling )
No. Hey, hey,
that's my bed!
You're going to get
your germs all over it.
( sighing ):
Fine.
My chair is
more comfortable anyway.
( yells )
What?
( speaking fearfully )
It's just a closet.
Will you go to sleep?
Hey, that looks like Randall.
Randall's your monster.
You think he's going
to come through the closet
and scare you.
Oh, boy,
how do I explain this?
Uh, it's empty.
-See?
-Ah!
No monster in here.
Well, now there is
but I'm not going to scare you.
I'm off-duty.
Okay.
How about I sit here,
until you fall asleep?
Go ahead.
Go to sleep.
Now.
Now... go.
Uh, you...
go...
to...
sleep.
( ioitating snoring )
( giggles )
( sighs in relief )
( door creaks softly )
Hey, Mike,
this might sound crazy
but I don't think
that kid's dangerous.
Really? Well, in that case,
let's keep it.
I always wanted a pet
that could kill me!
Now, look.
What if we just put
her back in her door?
What?
Mike, think about it.
If we send her back,
it's like it never happened.
Everything goes back to normal.
Is that a joke?
Tell me you're joking.
Sulley, I'd like to think
that, given the circumstances
I have been extremely
forgiving up to now
but that is a horrible idea!
What are we going to do?
March right out into
public with that thing?
Then I guess we just waltz
right up to the factory, right?
I can't believe we
are waltzing right
up to the factory.
Sulley, a mop,
a couple of lights
and some chair fabric
are not going
to fool anyone!
Just think about
a few names, will you?
Loch Ness, Bigfoot,
the Abominable Snowman--
they all got one thing
in common, pal-- banishment.
We could be next!
Don't panic--
we can do this.
Hey, how you doing, Frank?
Hey, guys.
Everything's going
to be okay.
( gasping )
( equipoent buzzing loudly )
Number One wants this place
dusted for prints.
Careful with that.
I got a good view from here.
A little lower.
This was recovered
at the scene.
Don't panic.
Don't panic!
Don't tell me
not to panic.
Just keep it together.
Everything is not okay!
LITTLE GIRL:
Boo.
...could be contaminated.
Gentlemen, safety
is our number one concern.
If there's anything that...
Not now, not now.
Oh, hello, little one.
Where did you come from?
Mr Waternoose!
Ah,James!
Is this one yours?
Actually, that's my, uh,
cousin's sister's daughter, sir.
Yeah, it's, uh...
''Bring an Obscure Relative
to Work Day.''
Hmm, must have
missed the memo.
Well, listen,James
why don't you stop by
the simulator after lunch today
and give us
that scare demonstration
we talked about, huh?
Oh, oh, sir, uh....
Excuse me,
Mr Waternoose?
Yes, yes, I'm coming.
All right then, I'll see
you this afternoon,James.
That is, if these gentlemen
haven't shut us down.
Oh, boy.
Oh, a scare demo.
Well, that is great.
Why am I
the last to know?
We can bring your cousin's
sister's daughter along.
She'll be a big hit!
( equipoent buzzing loudly )
Halt!
( yelling )
Stop him!
Hold him down.
Come on,
the coast is clear.
Okay, all we have to do
is get rid of that thing.
So, wait here while
I get its card key.
But she can't stay here.
This is the men's room.
That is the weirdest thing
you have ever said.
It's fine. It's okay.
Look, it loves it here!
It's dancing with joy!
Uh, uh, uh, uh.
I'll be right back
with its door key.
( laughs )
That's a cute little
dance you've got.
It almost looks
like you've got to...
( whining )
Oh.
( singing in baby talk )
( singing stops )
Uh, are you
done in there?
( squeals )
Ah! Sorry. Sorry.
( singing )
( toilet flushes )
Okay, you
finished now, right?
Hello?
( yells )
Boo.
( giggles )
( sighs )
( giggling )
( chuckles )
Where did she go?
Oh, did she disappear?
Did she turn invisible?
( giggling softly )
I just have no idea.
Gotcha!
Boo.
( giggles )
Hey, you're good.
( sighs )
Be relaxed,
be relaxed, be relaxed.
Roz, my tender,
oozing blossom
you're looking
fabulous today.
Is that a new haircut?
Come on, tell me.
It's a new haircut,
isn't it?
That's got to be
a new haircut.
New make-up?
You've had a lift.
You've had a tuck.
You've had something.
Something has been
inserted in your skin
that makes you look like...
( sighs )
Listen, I need a favour.
Randall was working
late last night
out on the scare floor.
I really need the key
for the door he was using.
Well, isn't that nice?
But guess what?
You didn't turn in
your paperwork last night.
He didn't... I...
no paperwork?
This office is now closed.
( Mike screaos in pain )
Ready or not, here I come!
I'm getting warmer.
Any second now.
Fee fi fo...
What are you doing?!
I-I'm looking
for the kid.
You lost it?!
No, no, she was just....
( squeals )
Here she is.
( whining )
Hey, what's the matter?
RAND ALL:
I already told your buddies
I haven't seen anything.
CD A AGENT:
All right. Carry on.
( splashing )
Randall!
Thank goodness!
What are we going to do
about the child?
Shh!
Shh, shh, shh.
( door slaos open )
( door slaos open )
The front page!
It's on the front page.
The child--
the one you were after.
Will you be quiet?!
Don't you think I'm aware
of the situation?
I was up all night
trying to find it.
I did a simple
calculation
factoring in the size
of the sushi restaurant.
The child
may have escaped!
Yeah, well, until
we know for sure
we're going to act like
nothing happened, understand?
You just get the
machine up and running.
I'll take care of the kid.
And when I find whoever
let it out, they're dead!
Oh!
Why are you still here?
Come on, go!
Move! Now!
FUNGUS:
Ow, ow! I'm not here.
SULLEY ( whispering ):
They're gone.
( squeaking and splashing )
LITTLE GIRL:
Ew.
MIKE:
This is bad.
This is so very bad.
What were they talking
about a machine?
Who cares? Oh!
Look, don't panic--
all we have to do
is call her door down
and send her home.
You're right.
You're right.
We're just two regular joes
on our way to work.
We will blend right in.
Top of the mornin', fellas!
Hey, what's shakin',
bacon?
Did you lose weight?
Or a limb?
You have
her card key, right?
Of course
I have her card key.
I told you
I'd get her card key.
I went and got
her card key
and now I have her card key.
Okay, here we go.
Take care of yourself.
Try not to run
through any more closets.
( giggles )
Mike,
that's not her door.
What are you
talking about?
Of course it's her door.
It's her door.
No, her door was white
and it had flowers on it.
No. It must have been
dark last night
because this is its door.
( polka ousic playing )
Hey, you hear that?
Sounds like fun in there!
Okay, send me a postcard, kid.
That's Mike Wazowski, care of
you-got-your-life-back Lane.
Mowki Kowski.
Very good.
Now bon voyage!
Bye-bye!
Come on.
Look at the stick.
See the stick?
Go get the stick!
Go fetch.
Mike, this isn't
Boo's door.
Boo? What's Boo?
That's what I decided
to call her.
Is there a problem?
Sulley, you're not
supposed to name it.
Once you name it,
you start getting attached to it!
Now put that thing
back where it came from,
or so help me...
Oh, hey!
We're rehearsing a scene
for the upcoming company play
~called Put That Thing
Back Where It Caoe Froo
Or So Help Me.
( Mike laughing )
It's a musical!
Put that thing back where
it came from or so help me
Bom-bom, bom-bom,
bom-bom...
So help me,
so help me.
And cut!
We're still working on it.
It's a work in progress
but, hey,
we need ushers.
Sulley, I've had enough.
Now say goodbye to...
where'd it go?
What'd you do with it?
( gasps ):
Where is she?
I don't believe it.
She got away
from you again?!
Well, that is just...
Wait a minute.
The sun is coming up.
This is perfect!
She's gone!
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Where are you going?
Sulley, please,
don't blow this.
Not when we're so close
to breaking the record.
Somebody else
will find the kid.
It'll be their problem,
not ours!
She's out of our hair!
What are you
two doing?
They're rehearsing a play.
She's out of our hair!
Can it, Wazowski!
So, what do you think
of that kid getting out, Sullivan?
Pretty crazy, huh?
Oh, yeah, crazy.
Word on the street is the kid's
been traced back
to this factory.
You haven't seen anything,
have you?
Uh, well, uh...
No, no way!
But if it was
an inside job
I'd put my money
on Waxford.
Waxford?
Yeah, the one
at station six.
You know, he's got
them shifty eyes.
Hey, Waxford!
Sulley!
CELIA:
Michael Wazowski!
( whiopers )
Last night was one
of the worst nights
of my entire life,
bar none!
( hissing )
I thought
you cared about me.
Honey, please.
Schmoopsie, I thought
you liked sushi.
CELIA:
Sushi? Sushi?!!
You think this is
about sushi?!
Wazowski!
Michael! Mike...
Men.
( panting )
Breathe. Keep breathing.
Whew.
Yikes!
Where's the kid?
Kid? What kid?
It's here in
the factory, isn't it?
You're not
pinning this on me.
It never would
have gotten out
if you hadn't been
cheating last night!
Cheating?
Cheating. Right.
Okay, I think I know how
to make this all go away.
What happens when
the whistle blows
in five minutes?
Uh... I get a time-out?
Everyone goes to lunch!
Which means the scare floor
will be...?
Painted?
Empty! It'll be
empty, you idiot!
You see that clock?
When the big hand
is pointing up
and the little hand
is pointing up
the kid's door
will be in my station.
But when the big hand
points down
the door will be gone.
You have until then
to put the kid back.
Get the picture?
( roaring playfully )
Boo!
( giggles )
No.
Hey, you! Halt!
He's the one.
The one from
the commercial!
Affirmative.
That's him.
Can we get
an autograph?
Oh, oh, sure.
No problem.
You can make that out
to Bethany, my daughter.
Yes. Let's see....
''From your scary friend
best wishes...''
So I said,
''If you talk to me
like that again,
we're through!''
What'd she say?
You know my mom.
She sent me to my room.
See you guys later.
Take it easy.
Bottoms up!
( gasps in horror )
No!
( singing )
Whoa!
Hey.
( growling )
Oh, well, hello, there.
What's your name?
Mike Wazowski!
( oachinery pounding loudly )
( grinding and chopping )
( panting )
( ooans )
Sulley!
Oh, Sulley.
Okay, Sulley, come on, enough.
Hey, you guys seen
Sulley anywhere?
Nope. Sorry.
Oh, Sulley!
Boy, Wazowski looks
like he's in trouble.
( squeaking and quacking )
We have a 231 9!
Oh, dear.
Get him!
Sulley?
Sulley!
( ooaning )
Sulley!
Oh, great news, pal.
I got us a way out of this mess
but we got to hurry.
Where is it?
( whiopering )
Sull, that's
a cube of garbage.
( squeaks )
Uh-oh.
I-I can still hear
her little voice.
BOO:
Mike Wazowski!
Hey, I can hear her, too.
BABY MONSTERS:
Mike Wazowski!
How many kids
you got in there?
Mike Wazowski!
Kitty!
Boo!
Boo, oh,
you're all right!
I was so worried!
Don't you ever run away
from me again, young lady!
Oh, but I'm so glad
you're safe.
My, what an affectionate father.
Actually, she's
my cousin's sister's...
Okay, Sulley.
That's enough.
Let's go.
Mike Wazowski!
Yeah, yeah.
Step aside, kid.
We're in a...
( screaos in pain )
( screaos with laughter )
( electrical buzzing )
( light bulbs shattering )
( gasping )
( baby oonsters screaoing
~ and crying )
Will you stop
making Boo laugh?
I didn't, so come on!
( screaoing and crying
~ continue )
I still don't understand.
You've got Boo's door?
I'll explain later.
Run.
Okay, let's move,
let's move, let's move.
Come on.
Oh, please be there, please
be there, please be there.
There it is!
Just like Randall said!
Randall?
Wait a minute.
( cries out in fear )
Oh, hey.
One, two, three, four!
Get the kid back
through the door!
Hey, hey.
We're going to get
our lives back.
The nightmare is over.
Hey, it's okay, Boo.
What's the matter?
Come on, it's time to move!
Mike, what are you thinking?
We can't trust Randall.
He's after Boo.
Who cares?
Let's go.
This is a limited time offer.
No, no.
I don't like this.
Look, Sulley, you wanted
her door and there it is.
Now, let's move.
No, Mike.
( sighs ):
You want me to prove
everything's on the up-and-up?
Fine! He wants the door,
I get the door...
( whispering ):
Mike, wait!
He's a paranoid
delusional furball.
Mike!
( whiopers in fear )
( whining )
Shh, shh, shh.
( soall cry of surprise )
( lunch bell rings )
Hey, Sulley,
where you been all day?
Sulley? Sulley?
Huh?
( whispering ):
Mike?
Mike?
Where are you?
You in there?
Where are you, buddy?
Mike?
Hey.
( door thunks )
( excited baby talk )
Boo, way to go.
( giggles )
It's okay.
( door clunks shut )
( pipes whistling and venting )
( distant voices )
RAND ALL:
Yes! I got the kid!
FUNGUS:
Oh, huzzah!
That's great news.
Not that I was concerned,
of course.
Just get over
here and help me!
Come on, come
on, come on.
While we're young
here, Fungus!
( both straining )
Kid needs to take
off a few pounds.
( yelps )
Wazowski?!
Where is it,
you little one-eyed cretin?
Okay, first of all,
it's cree-tin.
If you're going
to threaten me
do it properly.
Second of all, you're nuts
if you think kidnapping me
is going to help you cheat
your way to the top!
( chuckling evilly )
You still think this is about
that stupid scare record?
Well... I did, right up
until you chuckled like that
and now I'm thinking
I should just get out of here.
I am about to revolutionise
the scaring industry
and when I do, even
the great James P. Sullivan
is going to be
working for me.
MIKE:
Well
somebody's certainly
been a busy bee.
First, I need to know
where the kid is
and you're going
to tell me.
Yeah, I don't
know anything.
Uh-huh, sure.
MIKE:
I don't.
I mean, I don't.
Uh-oh.
( oechanical clanging
~ and grinding )
What's that?
Come on.
Wait, wait, wait.
Oh-oh. Oh-oh.
Oh, come on.
No, no, no, no, no.
Come on,
hey, hey, hey.
This thing is moving.
I don't like big...
moving things that are
moving towards me.
No! Come on!
Hey, Randall!
Say hello
to the scream extractor.
Hello.
Come on,
where you going?
We'll talk.
Come on,
we'll have a latte!
Come on.
We can talk
about this.
( electrical whirring starts,
~ then grows louder )
What's that thing?
What is that thing?
Wait, wait, wait!
Stop, stop!
No, no!
Come on, hey!
( deep, resonating whirring )
Help! Help! Help!
Help!
( yelling )
( noise dies away )
Oh, for...
What did you
do wrong this time?
I don't know.
I calibrated the drive...
Go check the machine!
There must be something wrong
with the scream intake valve.
That's the problem
with these 3250 units...
Huh?
Hmm.
Psst!
Fungus.
Fungus.
You like cars, huh?
'Cause I got a really nice car.
If you let me go,
I'll give you...
a ride in the car.
Please, Fungus?
I'm sorry, Wazowski,
but Randall said
I'm not allowed to fraternize
with victims of his evil plot.
( gasps )
( clanging )
Hmm...
( zapping )
( electrical whirring )
( clanking, rattling, whirring )
( gasps )
( ouffled screaos )
What happened?
Where's Wazowski?
( ouffled screaos )
( shuts off oachine )
Where is he?!
( whiopering )
( growls )
( whiopering )
( squeals )
Come on!
This is crazy.
He's going to kill us!
CD A AGENT:
Careful.
That could be contaminated.
We got to get out of here now!
We can start a whole new life
somewhere far away.
Goodbye, Monsters, Inc.!
Goodbye, Mr Waternoose!
No, Mike, wait!
Hey, what are you doing?
Follow me. I have an idea.
No! No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no...
COMPUTER VOICE ( over P.A. ):
Simulation terminated.
WATERNOOSE:
No, no, no, no, no.
What was that?
You're trying to scare the kid,
not lull it to sleep.
I was going for a
snake/ ninja approach
with a little hissing.
( hisses )
How many times
do I have to tell you?
It's all about presence!
About how you enter the room!
Mr Waternoose!
James! Perfect timing.
No, no. Sir, you
don't understand.
Ah, now, show these monsters
how it's done.
What? No, no,
I can't...
Sir...
sir, you have
to listen to me.
Pay attention, everyone.
You're about to see
the best in the business.
Reset the simulator.
But-but, sir!
MOTHER:
Good night, sweetheart.
ANIMATRONIC BO Y:
Night, Mom.
Kitty!
No, Boo, no, no!
Now, give us a big, loud roar.
Mr Waternoose,
there's no time for this.
Come on. What are you
waiting for? Roar!
But-but-but, sir!
Roar!
( groans )
( roaring ferociously )
( shrieking in terror )
( gasps )
( roaring ferociously )
( squeals )
( Boo crying )
( students applauding )
WATERNOOSE:
Well done.
Well done,James.
Boo?
-All right, gentlemen,
I hope you've learned...
-Right this way, everyone.
...a valuable lesson
in scaring today.
( fearful whioper )
( whines softly )
Boo.
( nervous grunt )
( whining )
Boo?
( panicked grunts )
( door slaos )
Boo, it's me.
( squealing )
( gasps ):
The child!
Sir, she isn't toxic.
I know it sounds
crazy, but trust me.
Boo?
No, no, no, no.
It's okay.
I was just...
( whiopering in fear )
No, no, no, no, no,
don't be scared.
That wasn't real.
It's just a...
I was just...
( crying ):
No...
( Boo continues crying )
( Boo sobbing )
Boo.
MIKE:
...and he was going
to test it out
on that sweet,
little girl.
Boo.
Now that we
have her...
...he is trying
to kill us.
This whole thing
is Randall's fault.
Randall?
Yes. And we can take
you to his secret lab,
which is right here
in this factory.
How could this happen?
Oh, how could this happen?
Does anyone else
know about this?
No, sir.
Good.
This company can't afford
any more bad publicity.
Now, before we do
anything else, let's...
take care of the child.
Oh, I never thought things
would come to this...
not in my factory.
I'm sorry you boys
got mixed up in this.
Especially you,James.
But now we can set
everything straight again
for the good of the company.
( whirring )
( thunk )
MIKE:
Uh...
sir, that's not her door.
I know, I know.
It's yours.
( startled gasps )
( grunts )
( yelling )
No!
( gasps )
( voice echoing ):
Boo!
( gasps )
No! No!
No! No! No! No!
No!
( desperate grunts )
It's too late!
We're banished, genius.
We're in the human world!
Oh, what a great idea, going
to your old pal Waternoose!
Too bad he was in
on the whole thing!
All you had to do was listen
to me--just once!
But you didn't, did you?
You're still not listening!
( yelling )
( Sulley grunting and groaning )
Take that!
( growling )
( gasps in horror )
Welcome to the Himalayas!
( wind gusting )
''Abominable''!
( chuckles )
Can you believe that?
Do I look abominable to you?
Why can't they call me
the Adorable Snowman or...
or the Agreeable Snowman,
for crying out loud?
I'm a nice guy.
Snow cone?
Yuck.
No, no, no.
Don't worry--
it's lemon.
Uh, how about
you, big fella?
Snow cone?
Did you see the way she...
looked at me?
( sighs )
Ah, poor guy.
I understand.
It ain't easy
being banished.
Take my buddy, Bigfoot.
When he was banished
he fashioned an enormous diaper
out of poison ivy.
Wore it on his head
like a tiara.
Called himself King Itchy.
Ah, it won't be so hard for
you guys, though, you know.
I mean, how lucky
can you get?
Banished with your
best friend.
He is not my friend.
Oh. I just assumed you
were buddies, you know
when I saw you out
there in the snow
hugging and all that.
Look at that big jerk.
Ruined my life, and for what?
A stupid kid!
Because of you,
I am now stuck
in this frozen
wasteland!
Wasteland?
I think you mean wonderland!
I mean, how about
all this fabulous snow, huh?
Oh, and wait till you see
the local village.
Cutest thing in the world.
I haven't even mentioned
all the free yak's milk.
What... what did you say?
Yak's milk.
Milking a yak
ain't exactly a picnic.
You know, once you pick
the hairs out
it's very nutritious.
No, no. Something
about a village.
Where?
Are there kids in it?
Kids? Sure.
Tough kids, sissy kids,
kids who climb on rocks...
Where is it?!
It's at the bottom
of the mountain.
Around a three-day hike.
Oh, three days?!
We need to get there now!
( thuop )
( ding )
You want to go to the village?
Okay, rule number one
out here.
Always...
No.
Never go out in a blizzard.
We need to get to Boo.
( grunts, then gasps )
Boo?!
What about us?
( grunts )
Ever since that kid
came in
you've ignored
everything I've said
and now look where we are!
Oh, we were about
to break the record, Sulley.
We would have had it made!
None of that matters now.
None of it matter...
Wa-wait a second.
None of it matters?
( sighs )
MIKE:
Okay.
That's.... no. Good. Great.
So, now the truth
comes out, doesn't it?
Oh, would you
look at that?
We're out of
snow cones, uh...
Let me... just go outside
and make some more.
Sulley, what about everything
we ever worked for?
Does that matter?
Huh?
And what about Celia?
I am never... never
going to see her again.
Doesn't that matter?
( sighs )
What about me?
I'm your pal.
I'm... I'm your best friend.
Don't I matter?
( sighs )
I'm sorry, Mike.
I'm sorry we're stuck out here.
I didn't mean
for this to happen.
But Boo's in trouble.
I think there might
be a way to save her
if we can just
get down to that...
''We''?
Whoa, whoa, whoa. ''We''?
No.
There's no ''we'' this time, pal.
I-if-if you want
to go out there
and freeze to death
you be my guest...
because you're on your own.
( wind whistles )
Hey, I got more snow cones!
Ohh!
Ahh!
Ahh!
( yells )
( grunting and groaning )
( wind howling )
( distant child screaoing )
( children screaoing )
Oh, come on, now, George.
I know you can do this.
I picked out an easy door
for you-- in Nepal.
Nice, quiet Nepal.
You know, you're right.
Here, take this.
Go get 'em, Georgie!
Gangway! Look out!
Coming through!
Sorry, George.
Hey, you can't just...
( gasps )
( gagging )
( whistling )
Out of the way!
-Hey!
-Whoa!
Don't!
( gasps )
( whiopers )
Finally!
I never should have
trusted you with this.
Because of you, I had
to banish my top scarer!
With this machine,
we won't need scarers.
Besides, Sullivan got
what he deserved.
Sullivan was twice the scarer
you will ever be!
( low growl )
( panting )
( clanging )
( grunting )
( yells with effort )
( oechanical whirring )
( gasps )
Kitty!
( whirring and hissing )
( yelling )
( shrieking )
( roaring )
Kitty!
Sullivan?
( grunting )
Wh-whoa!
Kitty!
Sorry, Boo.
Stop him!
( growls )
Let's get you home.
( panting )
( blow lands )
Ooh!
WATERNOOSE:
Finish him off!
Oh! Ooh! Oh!
( clanging )
( thunk )
You don't know how long
I've wanted to do
that, Sullivan.
( grunts )
( chuckles )
( punches landing )
Hah!
Ooh!
( shrieks )
( panting )
Ooh!
Mike?!
Look, it's not that I
don't care about the kid.
Mike, you don't
understand.
Yes, I do. I was
just mad, that's all.
I needed some time to think.
But you shouldn't
have left me out there.
( thuop )
I'm being attacked!
No, I'm not attacking you.
I'm trying to be honest.
Just hear me out.
You and I are a team.
Nothing is more important
than our friendship.
I-I-I know, kid.
He's too sensitive.
( gagging )
( whining cry )
Come on, pal.
If you start crying,
I'm going to cry
and I'll never get through this.
I'm sorry
I wasn't there for you
but I am now.
Ow!
Sulley, I am baring
my soul here.
The least you could do
is pay attention!
( yells in pain )
( sighs in relief )
Hey, look at that--
it's Randall! It's...
Oh.
Come on!
WATERNOOSE:
Get up!
There can't be
any witnesses.
There won't be.
I'm glad you came back, Mike.
Somebody's gotta take care
of you, you big hair ball.
( Celia screaoing )
( screaoing )
Ow!
Schmoopsie-poo,
I really can't talk.
Come on!
Michael, if you
don't tell me
what's going on right
now, we are through!
You hear me? Through!
Here's the truth.
You know the kid that they're
looking for-- Sulley let her in.
We tried to
send her back
but Waternoose
had this secret plot
and now Randall's right behind
us and he's trying to kill us!
You expect me to believe that
pack of lies, Mike Wazowski?!
Mike Wazowski!
( startled yell )
I love you, Schmoopsie-poo!
RAND ALL:
Move it! Look out, you...
Oh!
...idiot!
( huffing )
Look out. Coming through,
here, coming through!
Make way. Move it!
Hurry up. Hurry up.
There they are!
CELIA: ( over P.A. )
Attention, employees:
Randall Boggs
has just broken
the all-time scare record.
Huh?
No, I didn't.
Get out of my way!
( claoouring )
Go get 'em, Googley Bear!
( Boo shrieks )
There it is!
RAND ALL:
Get off my tail!
Let me through!
Sulley,
what are you doing?
Grab on, Mike!
Are you out of your...?
( screaoing )
( whirring )
( Mike whiopering )
MIKE:
Sulley, what are we doing?
We have to get Boo's door
and find a station.
MIKE:
What a plan--
simple, yet insane!
( growls )
Whoa.
Oh, boy. ( gasps )
Hold on!
( Mike screaoing )
( screaoing )
( clinking )
Wow!
Don't look down!
( teeth chattering )
( rattling )
( startled gasp )
( screaoing )
( shrieking )
I'm gonna be sick.
I'm gonna be sick!
Whoa!
( screaoing )
Oh, no!
( chugging and clanking )
No!
Aah...
Boo's door?
There it is!
MIKE:
How are we supposed
to get it now?
Oh, it's a dead
end, Sulley!
( gasps )
MIKE:
There he is.
Make her laugh.
What, Sulley?!
Just do it!
Oh... ow!
( laughing )
( squealing laughter )
( engines starting )
SULLEY:
Get it open.
Here he comes.
Give me that kid!
( birds twittering )
( Boo giggling )
Why couldn't we
get banished here?
Come on. We got to
find another door.
( gasps )
Look, Boo's door!
( grunting )
There he is!
Hurry up, hurry up!
Give me your hand.
( screaoing )
( grunts )
Come on, it slides,
it slides!
Ooh, right, right, right.
( panting )
( gasps )
Jump!
I'm behind you!
Come on!
Hurry up! Keep moving!
Get inside!
Ooh! That was weird.
( grunts )
Mike?
Oh, sorry, buddy.
( stunned ouobling )
( growls )
( electronic whirring )
Oh!
I hope that hurt, lizard boy!
( laughing )
Great job, buddy.
We lost him.
( squeals )
Boo!
Ha, ha!
No!
( screaoing )
Nice working with you!
Get it open!
-I'm trying!
-Open the door!
Come on, get in here!
( Boo crying )
( grunting )
Boo!
( panting )
( panting )
There they are!
Sulley, what are you doing?
Sulley!
( grunts )
( grunts )
( yells )
Looks like we caught
the express, pal.
Do you see them?
Straight ahead!
No...
( stifled cry )
( grunting nervously )
Kitty!
Boo!
( yelling )
( whiopering )
RAND ALL:
Look at everybody's
favourite scarer now!
You stupid, pathetic waste!
( thuop )
You've been number one
for too long, Sullivan.
Now your time is up!
And don't worry.
I'll take good care of the kid.
No!
( yelling )
( Boo grunting
~ and Randall gagging )
( Randall groaning )
( gagging )
( roaring angrily )
She's not scared
of you any more.
( roars angrily )
Looks like you're out of a job.
( gulps )
All right, come on,
over the plate.
Let's see
the ol' stuff here, pal.
Come on, now, chuck him,
chuck him, baby. Hum, baby.
Hum, baby,
here's the pitch.
Wait, please, don't,
don't, don't!
No!
And he is...
out of here!
( crickets chirping )
BO Y:
Mama, another gator
got in the house.
Another gator?!
Give me that shovel!
Come here!
( clanging, yelling )
Get him, Mama!
Get that gator!
Care to do the honours,
Mikey?
With pleasure.
( thud )
( baby talk )
That's right, Boo.
You did it.
You beat him.
( raspberry )
Come on.
Okay, Boo,
it's time to go home.
Take care of yourself,
and be a good girl, okay?
( gasps )
Oh, no!
The power's out!
Make her laugh again.
All right, I got a move here.
It'll bring down the house.
Up...
( oetallic clang )
( groans softly )
Oh, sorry, she didn't see that.
What?! What'd you do,
forget to check
if her stupid hood was up
ya big dope?!
( singsong ):
Uncle Mike, try not to yell
in front of her.
You know we still need her
to laugh.
Right.
( laughs )
Hey, Boo, just kidding. Look!
( gibberish )
Funny, right? Huh?
See what the...
These are the jokes, kid.
Whoa!
What's happening?
SULLEY:
Hold on!
When the door lands
in this station, cut the power.
You'll have the child
and the criminals responsible
for this whole mess.
Great.
A welcoming committee!
What are we going to do?!
( electrical huooing )
( clang )
This is the CD A.
Come out slowly
with the child
in plain sight.
Okay, okay.
You got us.
Here we are.
Here's the kid.
I'm cooperating.
But before you take us away,
I have one thing to say:
( gags )
Catch!
( all shouting ):
We have a toxic
projectile!
Halt! After the suspect!
Cover the area!
Bring in reinforcements!
WATERNOOSE:
Stop him!
( Boo squeaks )
Come on.
Don't let them get away.
What...?!
No, wait, wait!
Come back!
He has the child!
( frustrated growl )
( Boo squeaks )
Sullivan? Sullivan!
Give me the child!
Me not go!
Give her to me!
( panting )
( grunts )
( oetallic creaking )
WATERNOOSE:
Open this door!
Open this door!
( growling and pounding )
Hey!
Sullivan!
( yells )
WATERNOOSE:
Don't do it.
( beep )
Come on.
Don't go in that room!
( yelling )
I think we stopped him, Boo.
You're safe now.
You be a good girl, okay?
This has gone
far enough,James.
She's home now!
Just leave her alone!
I can't do that!
She's seen too much.
You both have.
It doesn't have to be this way.
I have no choice!
Times have changed.
Scaring isn't enough any more.
But kidnapping children?!
I'll kidnap
a thousand children
before I let
this company die
and I'll silence anyone
who gets in my way!
No!
( child's voice ):
Good night, Mom.
( wooan's voice ):
Good night, sweetheart.
Good night, Mom.
What, wh-what is this?!
What? Who? Huh?
COMPUTER:
Simulation terminated.
Simulation terminated.
Well, I don't know
about the rest of you guys
but I spotted
several big mistakes.
But-but-but how-how did...?
How did...?
MIKE:
You know what?
Let's watch my favourite part
again... shall we?
( repeating ):
I'll kidnap a thousand children
before I let this company die.
What...? Wha...?
I'll kidnap
a thousand children before...
( baby talk )
Shh, shh, shh, shh!
Shh!
I'll get him.
All right,
come with us, sir.
Wh-what are
you doing?
Take your
hands off me!
You can't arrest me!
I hope you're happy, Sullivan!
You've destroyed this company.
Monsters, Incorporated is dead!
Where will everyone
get their scream now?!
The energy crisis
will only get worse
because of you!
( loud clang )
Stay where you are.
Huh?
Number One
wants to talk to you.
Attention!
Hello, boys.
BOTH:
Roz?!
Two and a half years
of undercover work
were almost wasted
when you intercepted
that child, Mr Sullivan.
Of course, without your help,
I never would have known
that this went all the way up
to Waternoose.
( baby talk )
( gasps )
ROZ:
Now...
about the girl...
I just want to
send her home.
Very good.
( chioing tones )
Bring me a door shredder.
What, you mean... you mean,
I can't see her again?
That's the way it has to be.
I'll give you
five minutes.
( whirring huo )
Well, so long, kid.
Mike Wazowski!
Yeah.
Ah, Boo,
it's been fun.
Go ahead.
Go grow up.
( door creaking )
( squealing in delight )
( laughing )
Uh-uh, B-Boo...?
( speaking baby talk )
Um... Boo?
( speaking baby talk )
Oh, look at that.
Yeah, you know...
Oh, that's cute, yeah.
( baby talk )
Uh, Boo, um...
( squeaking toy )
Well, that's very nice.
( giggling )
Come here, you!
( squeals )
( both laughing )
Oh, he's a happy bear...
( giggling )
( baby talk )
Nothing's coming
out of your closet
to scare you
any more, right?
Mm...
Yeah.
Goodbye, Boo.
Kitty.
Kitty has to go.
Boo!
( gasps )
Kitty?
( ootor buzzing loudly )
( clicks off )
None of this
ever happened, gentlemen.
And I don't want to see
any paperwork on this.
( door closes )
Take him away.
( all ourouring )
I bet we get
the rest of the day off.
You idiot!
They're going
to shut down the factory!
( all gasp )
I'm telling you, pal,
when that wall went up
you should have seen the look
on Waternoose's face.
Whoo-hoo! I hope we get
a copy of that tape.
Hey, you all right?
Come on, pal,
cheer up, we did it!
We got Boo home.
Ah, sure, we put the factory
in the toilet, and...
gee, hundreds of people
will be out of work now.
Not to mention the angry mob
that'll come after us
when there's no more power,
but, hey...
at least we had
some laughs, right?
Laughs...
( crickets chirping )
( wind blowing softly )
( door quietly creaks open )
( boy gasps )
Hey, is this thing on?
Hello?
Hello?
Testing, testing.
Hey, good evening.
How are you?
How are you?
Nice to see you.
I tell you, it's good
to be here in... your room.
Where you from?
Never mind.
You're in
kindergarten, right?
Oh, I love kindergarten.
Best three years of my life.
Of my life.
But I love sports.
Dodgeball was the best.
Oh, yeah.
I was the fastest one out there.
Course I was the ball.
But I...
was the ball, see?
All right.
( ruobling )
( ruobling gets louder )
( gurgling )
Ah...
( huge burp )
Ah?
( laughing )
Hey, thanks a lot.
I'll be here all week.
Remember to tip your waitresses.
( guffawing )
( rippling gurgle )
( bell dings )
Great job, Mikey.
You filled your quota on
the first kid of the day.
Not bad, huh?
You know, only somebody
with perfect comedic timing
could produce this much energy
in one shot.
Uh-huh, and the fact
that laughter is
ten times more
powerful than scream
had nothing to do with it.
( clears throat )
CELIA:
Oh, Googley Bear.
Come here, you.
Schmoopsie-poo!
Googley.
Whoa!
( snakes chittering )
( Mike giggling )
Girls!
Girls, put...
Stop, stop, stop!
Michael,
you're such a charmer.
Hey, did you bring
the magazine?
They just delivered
a whole box.
Let me see it!
( laughing )
Sulley and I
made the cover, right?
( whispering ):
I don't believe it.
( syopathetically ):
~Googley Bear...
I'm on the cover
of a magazine!
Ow!
( chattering )
( jittering blubbers )
Oh, this is great!
( huooing happily )
( child laughing uproariously )
( bell dings )
Oh.
( distant laughter )
( kazoo whirs )
( toy horn toots )
MIKE:
Hey, Sulley!
( yells )
Hey, uh, Mike.
I was, uh, just...
Well, listen,
if you got a minute
there's something
I want to show you.
But-but-but...
Okay, close your eyes.
Follow me.
Come on.
I-I-I...
No peeking.
Keep coming,
keep coming,
keep coming.
Come on,
keep coming.
Keep coming,
keep coming.
Mike...
Follow the sultry
sound of my voice.
Okay, stop.
Open them.
Ta-da!
Mike...
is that...?
Sorry it took
so long, pal.
It was a lot of wood
to go through.
You know,
it only works
if you have
every piece.
( whirring huo )
( creaking )
Boo?
BOO:
Kitty!
( bouncy blues oelody plays )
-Speed.
-Marker.
And... action.
SULLEY:
If I were a rich man
With a million or two
MIKE:
I'd live in
a penthouse
In a room
with a view
And if I were handsome
No way.
It could happen.
Those dreams
do come true
I wouldn't have nothing
if I didn't have you
Wouldn't have nothing
if I didn't have
Wouldn't have nothing
if I didn't have
Wouldn't have nothing...
( giggling )
DIRECTOR:
Okay, cut.
( flushing )
Okay, you finished
now, right?
Hello?
Hello.
( yells )
( laughs )
( both laugh )
Come on, get lost, you two.
You're making him
lose his focus.
Oh, sorry.
See you later, fellas.
Go get 'em, Mr Solomon.
You idiot!
It's Sullivan, not Solomon!
What?
You're messing up the scene!
Sorry.
We're never going to work
in Hollywood again!
Let me do it over.
Shut up!
Keep rolling!
You're making it worse!
JERRY:
Duck and cover, people!
( squeaking )
Hey, thanks, guys.
That was a close one.
( yelling )
Ta-da!
( all laughing )
Oh, Boo, it's been fun.
Go ahead.
Go throw up.
( Boo giggles )
What?
What did I say?
What? What?
Cut.
Hey, Ted!
Good morning!
( unrealistic roaring )
Cut.
Hey, how was that?
Was I scary?
Do I get the part?
Thank you.
Can I do it again?
I can be taller!
Next!
And action!
Okay, let's move.
Let's move, let's move!
( yelling )
( loud crash )
Ow!
( laughter )
Can we get a little more wax
on the floor, please?
Wait a minute.
Randall?
That cheater!
He's trying
to boost his numbers!
There's something else.
What?!
Look-lay in the bag-bay.
I think you mean
''Ook-lay in the ag-bay.''
What? Didn't I...?
Well, you know, maybe
you should just take a minute
and ead-ray
your ipt-scray.
( chuckles )
You think he's in going
to come through the closet
and scare you.
Oh, boy, how do I explain this?
Uh, it's empty.
See?
Guess who.
( laughter )
Action.
Hey, what's the...
( laughing )
( chuckles )
Okay, very funny.
Hey, I look good in a suit.
Marker.
And action.
Let her rip.
Go.
( loud whirring )
Whoa!
Shut it off!
Shut it off!
( yelling )
Pull the lever!
( yells )
You're making it worse!
MIKE:
But I must admit it
Big guy, you
always come through
I wouldn't have nothing
if I didn't have you
BOTH:
You and me together
That's how it
always should be
One without the other
don't mean nothing to me
Nothing to me...
Oh, hey!
We're rehearsing a scene
for the upcoming company play
~called Put That Thing Back
Where It Caoe Froo
Or So Help Me.
( Mike laughing )
It's a musical!
Put that thing back where
it came from or so help me
Bom-bom, bom-bom,
bom-bom...
Get that thing
away from me, you guys
Put that thing back
where it came from
Or I'll poke myself
in the eye!
It's a work in progress.
It's gonna get better.
Ladies and gentlemen
welcome to this year's
company play
starring, written
and directed by Mike...
and produced!
And produced
by Mike Wazowski.
Oh.
( applause and cheers )
( piano plays bouncy tune )
Put that thing back where
it came from, or so help me
So help me
So help me get by
Put that thing back
where it came from
Or so help me
So help me
I just gotta cry...
Your seat is right
over there, sir.
Boo!
There's a child,
there's a child
There's a human child
Oh, no!
Running
'round the restaurant
This is really wild
( screaoing )
What in heaven's name
will become of us?
We who are living
in Monstropolis?
( tinkling crash )
( piano segues to ballad )
All right, Wazowski.
Tell us where the kid is.
( booing and hissing )
I will never talk!
Never!
She's out of our hair
( light applause and whistles )
And just when I dare...
to care
She says, ''au contraire''
You're my pair...
of friends
I love you.
( sobbing loudly )
Keep it together, man!
And so we put that kid
back where she came from
And she helped us to find
A better tomorrow today!
Thank you!
What a night for my mother
to be in the audience!
Ladies and gentlemen
my mom!
( whistling loudly )
Thank you, Monstropolis!
BOTH:
I don't have to say it
SULLEY:
Ah, say it anyway.
MIKE:
'Cause we...
Both know it's true
I wouldn't have nothing
if I didn't have
I wouldn't have
nothing if I didn't have
I wouldn't have nothing
if I didn't have you
Wouldn't have nothing
if I didn't have you.
( ousic ends )
One more time.
( ousic begins again )
It worked!
I don't have to say it
I'm gonna anyway!
'Cause we both
know it's true
Let's take it
home, big guy.
BOTH:
I wouldn't have nothing
if I didn't have
I wouldn't have
nothing if I didn't have
I wouldn't have nothing
if I didn't have you
You, you
A, E, I, O...
That means you, yeah.
( ousic ends )


# The neck bone's
connected # To the head bone
# The head bone's
connected to the horn bone
Ah!
I scared you!
No, you didn't.
Okay!
Remember our field trip rules, everyone.
Uh, no pushing, no biting,
and no fire breathing!
What did I just say?
Eighteen, nineteen...
Okay, we're missing one.
Who are we missing?
Oh. Mike Wazowski.
Thanks, Joe.
Good luck finishing
your crossword puzzle.
Sorry, Michael.
I didn't see you.
That's okay.
When I was on the bus,
I found a nickel!
I wish I had pockets.
Okay, everyone, partner up.
Get your field trip buddy.
Jeremy! You and me?
Okay, no biggie.
Hailey? No?
Pairing up with Claire?
Great choice.
She's a good egg.
Russell.
Mike? Wazowski?
We car-pool?
- We're cousins.
- Hey!
Okay. Good catching up.
Well, Michael, it looks like
it's you and me again.
Come on, Karen.
We're falling behind.
Please don't call me Karen.
Now, stay close together.
We're entering
a very dangerous area.
Welcome to the Scare Floor.
Wow!
This is where we collect the Scream Energy
to power our whole world.
And can anyone tell me whose job
it is to go get that scream?
Scarers!
That's right!
Now, which one of you can
give me the scariest roar?
Me, me, me!
Oh! Sir! Right here!
Little green guy,
two o'clock!
No, it's like this.
Hey, guys, watch this one.
Hey, I got a really good...
Wow!
Whoa.
Well, hey there, kids.
Are you on a tour with your school?
- Yeah!
- Yes.
We're here to learn
about Scream Energy
and what it takes
to be a Scarer.
Well, hey, you're in luck,
because I just happen to be a Scarer.
I learned everything
I know from my school,
Monsters University.
Whoa.
It's the best
Scaring School there is.
You wish!
Fear Tech's the best.
Okay. You guys
watch us and tell me
which school's the best.
All right?
MU is.
Let's go, everybody!
West coast coming onli.
Scarers coming o.
Oops.
Stop right there.
Don't cross over
that safety line.
Human children
are extremely toxic.
Look at that!
Whoa! Hey, guys,
watch the eye! Ow!
Look at that! It's amazing!
I know!
- Wow!
- Excuse me. Fellas.
How about we do
tallest in the back?
Look, he's going to
do a real scare!
Cool. I want to
be a Scarer.
Yeah. Me, too.
Come on, guys.
I want to see.
Out of the way, Wazowski.
You don't belong
on a Scare Floor.
Brian! Do not step
over the line.
Mrs. Graves,
Michael went over the line.
Michael!
See?
I told you. He's fine.
Well,
I thought I heard something.
What?
Are you okay?
You could have gotten hurt!
I don't understand
how this could happen!
That was real dangerous, kid.
I didn't even know you were in there.
Wow. I didn't even know
you were in there.
Not bad, kid.
Michael, what do you have
to say for yourself?
How do I become a Scarer?
Monsters University!
Anybody getting off?
Well, everyone,
I don't mean to get emotional,
but everything in my life
has led to this moment.
Let it not be just the
beginning of my dream
but the beginning
of all of our dreams.
Gladys, promise me
you'll keep auditioning.
Marie, Mr. Right is
out there somewhere.
Phil, keep using the ointment
till that thing goes away.
I wish you all the best.
Thank you all so much!
I'm welling up with tears.
Now, get off.
Hello. How are you doing?
Ah!
Whoo-hoo!
Stroke! Stroke!
Come on,
put all you have into it!
Stroke! Stroke!
Okay! First thing on
my list, get registered.
Hey there, freshman.
I'm Jay the R.A.,
and I'm here to say that
registration is thataway!
Okay, Jay.
Have a great first day.
Hey, I'm Kay!
Here's your orientation packet.
Thanks, Kay.
You can drop your bags off here
and get your
picture taken with Trey.
Say hooray!
Hooray!
I can't believe it.
I'm officially
a college student!
Okay, everyone, I'm Fay,
and I'll be giving you your
orientation tour on this perfect day!
Here are the labs
where students learn
to design and build the
doors to the human world.
Looks like the professor
is about to test a door!
The MU cafeteria serves a full buffet,
three meals a day.
I personally believe we have some
of the best chefs in the world.
Oh! Yeah!
Yeah!
The campus offers
a wide variety of majors,
but the crown jewel of MU
is the Scaring School.
Welcome to the debate team.
We're happy to have you.
I disagree for
the following reasons.
True happiness is a
theoretical construct...
Hey there! Keep
your eye on the sky
at the astronomy club!
Hey, hey, hey! Come
join the improv club.
You'll wish you were a...
Never... Always...
Ah, dang it!
MU's Greek Council.
We sponsor the annual Scare Games.
The Scare what now?
The Scare Games!
A super-intense
Scaring competition!
They're crazy dangerous,
so anything could happen.
A bunch of guys went
to the hospital last year!
You could totally die.
And it's worth it.
You get a chance to prove
that you are the best!
Cool.
Wazowski, Room 319.
You know, your roommate
is a Scaring major, too.
"Hello, I'm your roommate."
Oh, that's too bland.
Don't force it.
Just let it happen.
Your lifelong best friend
is right behind this door.
Hey there.
I'm your roomie.
Name's Randy Boggs.
Scaring major.
Oh!
Mike Wazowski, Scaring major.
I can tell we're going
to be best chums, Mike.
Take whichever bed you want.
I wanted you to
have first dibs.
Ahh!
You just disappeared.
Sorry. If I do that in Scaring class,
I'll be a joke.
No, it's totally great.
You got to use it.
Really?
Yeah, but lose the glasses.
They give it away.
Huh.
Okay!
Unpack. Check.
Hang posters. Check.
Now I just need to ace my classes,
graduate with honors,
and become
the greatest Scarer ever.
Boy, I wish I had
your confidence, Mike.
Aren't you even
a little nervous?
Actually, no.
I've been waiting
for this my whole life.
I just can't
wait to get started.
Oh, man! I can't be
late on the first day!
Wow.
You got to be kidding me.
I'm so nervous!
Relax. It will be fine.
Good morning, students.
Welcome to Scaring 101.
I am Professor Knight.
Now I'm sure all of you were the
scariest monster in your town.
Well, bad news, kids.
You're in my town now,
and I do not scare easily.
Dean Hardscrabble.
This is a pleasant surprise.
She's a legend.
She broke
the all-time Scare Record
with the scream
in that very can!
I don't mean to interrupt.
I just thought I'd drop by
to see the terrifying faces
joining my program.
Well, I'm sure my students
would love to hear
a few words of inspiration.
Inspiration? Very well.
Scariness is the true
measure of a monster.
If you're not scary
what kind of a monster are you?
It's my job to make
great students greater,
not make mediocre students
less mediocre.
That is why at the end of the
semester there will be a final exam.
Fail that exam and you are
out of the Scaring program.
So,
I should hope you're all properly inspired.
All right. All right.
Who can tell me the properties
of an effective roar?
Yes?
There are actually five.
Those include
the roar's resonance,
the duration of the roar,
and the...
Whoops. Sorry.
I heard someone say "roar,"
so I just kind of went for it.
Oh, excuse me, sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you there.
Hey, how you doing?
Very impressive, Mister...
Sullivan.
Jimmy Sullivan.
Sullivan.
Like Bill Sullivan, the Scarer?
Yeah. He's my dad.
He's a Sullivan!
I should have known.
I expect big things from you.
Well, you won't
be disappointed.
Uh... I'm sorry.
Should I keep going?
No, no.
Mr. Sullivan's covered it.
Huh.
Everyone take out
your Scaring textbooks
and open them to chapter one.
Hey, bub.
Can I borrow a pencil?
I forgot all my stuff.
Ah! All right. Yes.
There we go. That will get it.
Mmm... Yeah.
Come on, Mike.
It's a fraternity
and sorority party.
We have to go!
If we flunk that Scaring final,
we are done.
I'm not taking any chances.
You've got
the whole semester to study,
but this might
be our only chance
to get in good
with the cool kids.
That's why I made these cupcakes.
Oops.
That could
have been embarrassing.
When I'm a Scarer,
life will be a nonstop party.
Stay out of trouble, wild man.
Wild man.
What the...
Archie!
Boo!
Hey! What are you...
Wait... You're shushing me?
Hey! Hey! You can't...
- Where did he go?
- He's dead meat.
That guy's in big trouble.
Yeah, he is.
Hey, guys!
Over here!
Fear Tech dummies.
Oh, oh!
Sorry about that, buddy.
Why are you in my room?
Your room? This is my...
This is not my room.
Archie! Come here, boy.
Archie?
Archie the Scare Pig.
He's Fear Tech's mascot.
Why is it here?
I stole it. Going to
take it to the RORs.
The what?
Roar Omega Roar.
The top fraternity on campus.
They only accept
the highly elite.
Okay, I'll lift the bed,
you grab the pig.
Ready? One, two, three.
What? No, no... Oh! What...
That's it.
Don't let go.
Careful. He's a biter.
- Whoa! Whoa, hey...
- Whoa!
I got him!
Uh-oh! Whoa!
That was awesome!
What am I doing?
James P. Sullivan.
Mike Wazowski.
Listen,
it was quite delightful meeting you
and whatever that is,
but if you don't mind,
I have to study my Scaring.
You don't need
to study Scaring.
You just do it.
Really? I think there's a
little more to it than that.
But, hey, thanks
for stopping by.
Let go of that!
My hat!
My pig!
Ooh!
Hey! Come here!
Hey!
Catch it!
Come back here!
Ooh! Yeah!
Ride it to frat row!
Hey!
Whoa... Ow!
Wow!
Whoa!
Go, go, go!
Hey...
Come on! Hey!
Ooh!
Cupcake?
Whoa...
Ooh!
Got it!
Fear Tech's mascot!
MU rules!
M-U! M-U! M-U!
Did you see him catch that pig?
You are Jaws Theta Chi
material, freshman.
Oh, thanks.
I don't know...
No, no, no.
He's an Omega Howl guy.
Back off.
We saw him first.
No way. We did!
I'll take it
from here, gentlemen.
Johnny Worthington,
president of Roar Omega Roar.
What's your name, big blue?
Jimmy Sullivan.
Friends call me Sulley.
This guy's a Sullivan?
Like the famous Sullivan?
I can't believe it!
That is crazy!
Chet, calm down.
I'm sorry.
Sulley, any freshman with the guts
to pull off a stunt like that
has got "Future Scarer"
written all over him.
Hey, did you see me ride the pig?
That took guts.
Slow down, squirt.
This party is for Scare students only.
Oh, sorry, killer,
but you might want to hang out
with someone
a little more your speed.
Uh... They look fun!
Oh, hey there. Want
to join Oozma Kappa?
We have cake.
Go crazy.
Is that a joke?
Sulley, talk to your friend.
Oh, he's not really
my friend, but sure.
You heard him.
This is a party for Scare students.
I am a Scare student.
I mean for Scare
students who actually,
you know, have a chance.
Aw, snap!
My chances are
just as good as yours.
You're not even in the
same league with me.
Just wait, hotshot.
I'm going to scare circles
around you this year.
Oh, okay.
I'd like to see that.
Oh, don't worry. You will.
Ready position.
Common crouch.
I want to see matted fur and yellow teeth.
Basic snarl.
Show me some slobber.
Drool is a tool,
kids. Use it.
Now here is a monster
who looks like a Scarer.
You want a hope of passing
this class, you better eat,
breathe, and sleep Scaring.
Yeah!
Give me another one.
Fear of spiders.
Arachnophobia.
Fear of thunder.
Keraunophobia.
Fear of chopsticks!
Consecotaleophobia.
What is this, kindergarten?
Give me a hard one.
Go Monsters U!
You know what to do!
The answer is C, fangs.
Well done, Mr. Wazowski.
A bowl of spiders!
Correct!
A clown running in the dark!
Right again.
Warts, boils, and moles,
in that order.
Outstanding!
Ah! Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Ah!
Ogre slump.
Zombie snarl.
Dominant silverback gorilla.
That is some remarkable
improvement, Michael.
One frightening face does not
a Scarer make, Mr. Sullivan.
A Tauntaun grimace
with extra slobber.
You got it!
That's what I'm saying.
I am going to wipe the floor
with that little know-it-all.
Yes, you are, big blue.
Hey, wait.
What are you guys...
It's just a precaution.
RORs are the best Scarers
on campus, Sullivan.
Can't have a member getting
shown up by a beach ball.
Whoo-hoo!
I am on a roll.
I'm going to destroy that guy.
Well, then you'll get
this back right away.
It's time to start delivering
on that Sullivan name.
Today's final will judge your
ability to assess a child's fear
and perform the appropriate
Scare in the Scare Simulator.
The Child Sensitivity
Level will be raised
from Bed-wetter
to Heavy Sleeper,
so give it
everything you've got.
Dean Hardscrabble is
with us this morning
to see who will be moving on
in the Scaring program
and who will not.
Let's get started.
I am a five-year-old girl afraid
of spiders and Santa Claus.
Which Scare do you use?
Uh...
That's a Seasonal
Creep and Crawl.
Demonstrate.
Results will be posted
outside my office. Next.
Focus.
Johnson, Crackle and Howl.
Yes!
Hey. Do you mind?
Don't mind at all.
Come on, Mike.
Let's just move.
Stay out of my way.
Unlike you, I had to work hard
to get into the Scare program.
That's because
you don't belong here.
That's what I thought.
Whoa! Whoa...
I'm so sorry.
It was an accident.
What? This?
My one souvenir from
a lifetime of Scaring?
Accidents happen, don't they.
The important thing
is no one got hurt.
You're taking
this remarkably well.
Now, let's continue the exams.
Mr. Wazowski,
I'm a five-year-old girl
on a farm in Kansas
afraid of lightning.
Which Scare do you use?
Shouldn't I go up on the...
Which Scare do you use?
That is a Shadow Approach
with a Crackle Holler.
Demonstrate.
Stop. Thank you.
But I didn't get to...
I've seen enough.
I'm a seven-year-old boy...
I wasn't finished.
I don't need to know
any of that stuff to scare.
That "stuff"
would've informed you
that this particular child
is afraid of snakes.
So a roar wouldn't make him scream,
it would make him cry,
alerting his parents,
exposing the monster world,
destroying life as we know it,
and of course
we can't have that.
So I'm afraid I cannot
recommend that you continue
in the Scaring program.
Good day.
Wait, what?
But I'm a Sullivan.
Well then, I'm sure your family
will be very disappointed.
And, Mr. Wazowski,
what you lack is something
that cannot be taught.
You're not scary.
You will not be continuing
in the Scaring program.
Please. Let me try the simulator.
I'll surprise you.
Surprise me?
I doubt that very much.
Welcome back.
I hope everyone
had a pleasant bre.
Some say that a career as a
scream-can designer is boring,
unchallenging, a waste
of a monster's potential.
Open your textbooks
to chapter three.
We will now plunge
into the rich history
of scream-can design.
Out of my way!
Coming through!
Oh, sorry. Ha-ha!
Welcome to this year's
Greek Scare Games kickoff.
The Scare Game!
Yeah!
Okay, relax.
We have a special guest,
the founder of the games,
Dean Hardscrabble.
Good afterno.
As a student,
I created these gas
as a friendly competition,
but be prepared.
To take home the troph,
you must be the most
fearsome monsters on campus.
So good luck, and may
the best monsters wi.
All right, everybody.
We're closing down sign-,
so we'll see you all...
Wait!
I'm signing up!
What?
Uh...
You have to be in a fraterniy to compete.
Behold the next winning
fraternity of the Scare Games,
the brothers, my brothers,
of Oozma Kappa!
Hi.
Mr. Wazowski,
what are you doing?
You just said the winners are the
most fearsome monsters on campus.
If I win,
it means you kicked out the best Scarer
in the whole school.
That won't happen.
How about a little wager?
If I win, you let me back
in the Scaring program.
And what would that prove?
That you were wrong.
Very well.
If you win, I will
let your entire team
into the Scare program.
But if you lose,
you will leave
Monsters University.
Deal.
Now all you need to do is find
enough members to compete.
We need six guys, right?
Sorry, chief.
We count bodies, not heads.
That dude counts as one.
Anybody else want to join our team?
Anyone at all?
Excuse me.
Sorry. I'm late.
Can I squeeze by you?
Randy!
Randy, thank goodness.
I need you on my team.
Oh. Sorry.
I'm already on a team.
Boggs.
I'm finally in with
the cool kids, Mike.
Don't blow this for me.
Do the thing.
Oh! Where did he go?
Please, anybody.
I need one more monster.
Just one more!
Yeah, sorry.
Doesn't look good.
We have to move on.
Your team doesn't qualify.
Yes, it does!
The star player
has just arrived.
No way! Someone else!
Please! Anyone else.
We're shutting down sign-ups, okay?
Is he on your team or not?
Come on! Let's go!
Fine! Yes,
he's on my team.
Good luck.
All right, Wazowski,
what's the plan?
This is a fraternity house?
Hey there, teammateys!
Come on aboard!
As the president
of Oozma Kappa,
it is my honor to welcome
you to your new home.
We call this room
"Party Central."
Technically,
we haven't actually had a party here yet.
But when we do, we'll be ready!
Whoo!
The hot cocoa train
is coming through! Whoa!
Next stop... You!
I would like to
start us off first by...
So, you guys
are Scaring majors?
We were!
None of us lasted very long.
I guess we just weren't what old
Hardscrabble was looking for.
Don Carlton, mature student.
Thirty years in
the textile industry
and then old dandy Don
got downsized.
Figured I could throw
myself a pity party,
or go back to school
and learn the computers.
Hello. I'm Terry
with a "Y"...
And I'm Terri with an "I"!
I'm a dance major!
And I'm not.
Five, six, seven, eight!
Seven, eight, turn! And...
Why didn't you turn?
Because we never
agreed to do this!
You said this was
going to be cool!
No one said
this was gonna be cool.
Now I'm embarrassed.
Now you're embarrassed?
Yes, because
it's in front of people!
You should wake up embarrassed.
Hey, hey, hey!
I'm Art!
New Age philosophy major.
Excited to live with you
and laugh with you,
and cry with you.
Thought you might like
to keep a dream journal.
Guess that leaves me.
Ah!
My name's Scott Squibbles.
My friends call me Squishy.
I'm undeclared, unattached,
and unwelcome pretty much
everywhere but here.
Now that we've all been introduced,
as captain of our team...
So, basically, you guys have
no Scaring experience?
Not a lot!
But now we've got you!
You're about the scariest
fella I've ever seen.
Even with them pink polka dots.
Aw, thanks.
Actually, I think I bring
the whole package.
Your hands are
as big as my face!
He's like a mountain with fur!
Oh, come on.
I don't even work out.
- Yeah, me neither.
- I don't want to get too big.
We thought our dreams were over,
but Mike said if we win,
they're letting us in
the Scaring program.
We're going to be real Scarers!
The best!
You betcha!
Yeah!
Right.
And here's what you've been
waiting for, fellas.
Your very own
Oozma Kappa bedroom.
Oh... Great!
We're sharing this room?
We'll let you guys get settled.
Anything you need,
you just give a big holler-oonie!
Okay, thanks, buddy.
Are you kidding me?
Look, they don't
need to be good.
I'm going to
carry the whole team.
Really? And who's
going to carry you?
Hey, if you want to
go back to can design,
you know where the door is.
Great.
Guys?
Anybody home?
Um...
Hello?
Fellas?
Do you pledge your souls
to the Oozma Kappa brotherhood?
Ow!
Do you swear to
keep secret...
all that you learn here?
No matter how horrifying?
Hey!
Will you take the sacred
oath of the...
For crying out loud.
Sweetie!
Turn the lights on
while you're down here!
You're going to ruin your eyes!
Mom!
We're doing an initiation!
Oh, scary.
Well, carry on.
Just pretend I'm not here.
This is my mom's house.
Do you promise to look out
for your brothers...
no matter what the peril?
Will you defend Oozma Kappa
no matter how dangerous?
No matter how insurmountable
the odds may be?
From evils both
great and small?
In the face of
unending pain and...
Oh, forget it!
You're in.
Look, we know
we're no one's first choice
for a fraternity,
so it means a lot
to have you here with us.
Can't wait to start Scaring
with you, brothers.
Time for a celebration!
Yeah!
Grab the couch cushions,
gentlemen,
because we're building a fort!
Mom, can we
stay up late tonight?
Mmm, I know you're a princess
and I'm just a stable boy.
Yuck!
Mom! What are you doing?
Your grubby paw was in my bed!
Were you kissing my hand?
No. And what about you
with all your shedding?
I don't shed.
Really.
Uh...
Excuse me.
I just want to get my stuff.
Would you just...
Oh, hey. Come on!
Let me get my stuff!
My butt!
First morning in the house.
That's going in the album!
Guys!
We got a letter!
A letter?
We never get mail.
Oh! Sorry.
It's stuck.
Would you...
Give me that!
Tentacles.
They're sticky.
It's the first event
of the Scare Games.
"A child's room
is where you scare,
"but avoid
the toxicity lurking there."
Wait a minute.
Where do they want us to meet?
Of all the sewers on campus,
this one has always been my favorite.
Art, you've been here before?
I have a life outside of the house,
you know.
Welcome to your
worst nightmare,
the Scare Games!
Scare Games! Scare Games!
Yes!
Yes, I love it!
I love this energy!
Okay. Okay, everybody.
Let's hear it for the frats and sororities
competing in
this year's games...
Jaws Theta Chi!
Python Nu Kappa!
Slugma Slugma Kappa!
Roar Omega Roar!
Eta Hiss Hiss!
And finally, Oozma Kappa.
Yay! Whoo-hoo!
Hi, Mom!
Smile!
Let's begin
the first competition,
the Toxicity Challenge!
Human children are toxic!
And anything
they touch is toxic.
We don't have any human toys,
but thanks to MU's
biology department,
we found a close second,
the stinging glow urchin!
Trust me when I say,
you are not gonna want
to touch this bad boy!
I want to touch it.
And you certainly don't want
to touch any of its friends.
Yeah, I want to touch them.
This is the starting line.
The light at the end of the
tunnel is the finish line.
And whoever comes in last is
eliminated from the games.
Mike...
What is it?
Does that mean if
we lose, we're out?
Don't worry, Smoothie.
Squishy!
Squishy.
We're not going to lose,
because we have everything
we need to win right here.
Heart.
No! Me. I'm going to
win the race for us.
All right, all right.
That's very cute,
but move, move, move.
I'm going to win this.
It's an obstacle course.
What are you going to do? Roar at it?
I can get through faster than you,
little guy.
Take your place at
the starting line!
This is all about teamwork.
Everybody, stick together.
I'm going to beat you
over that finish line.
Get ready to eat my dust.
Hey, guys, should we huddle up?
Attention, teams.
One last thing.
Scarers work in the dark.
I want to go home!
On your marks...
Hey, uh, good luck, ladies.
Thanks! We're going to
rip you to pieces!
What?
Get set...
Go!
I'm going to touch them!
Ow!
Come on!
Uh, guys!
We're falling behind a little! Fellas!
Cheese and crackers!
Son of a moustache!
Salisbury steak, that hurts!
Is that as fast as you can go?
Just getting started!
What the...
Whoa! Ah!
Oh... Ah!
That's got to hurt!
Ow, ow, ow...
Ooh!
Terry!
Don't worry, we'll be fi...
Ha-ha!
Oh...
Uh-oh. Yikes!
Ow! Ow, ow, ow...
Roar Omega Roar wins!
Take that, Wazowski!
Are you delirious?
I beat you!
Get your eye checked!
Oh, way to blow it, Oozmas!
Hey! Second place
ain't bad.
Second place, Jaws Theta Chi!
What?
Your whole team has to
cross the finish line.
Third place, EEKs!
- Fourth place, PNKs!
- No.
Fifth place, HSS!
No, no, no!
And in last place,
Oozma Kappa.
I can't feel my anything.
Oh... Shocker! Oozma Kappa
has been eliminated!
No.
Don't look so surprised,
Mr. Wazowski.
It would have taken
a miracle for you to...
Attention, everyone.
We have an announcement.
Jaws Theta Chi has
been disqualified.
The use of illegal protective
gel is cause for elimination.
What!
Which means Oozma Kappa
is back in the games!
It's a miracle!
Your luck will
run out, eventually.
This is going to be
harder than I thought.
Okay!
Listen up, Oozmas.
Now, we're going to have to start
winning these things together,
so that means I'm going to need
each of you guys
to pull your own weight.
Mike?
What is it?
We've made a list of our
strengths and weaknesses.
In high school,
I was the master of the silent scare.
I could sneak up
on a field mouse
in a pillow factory.
Sorry! They get stickier
when I'm sweaty.
Oh, my gosh, that's terrible.
We're experts in the ancient
craft of close-up magic.
It's all about misdirection.
Uh...
I have an extra toe.
Not with me, of course.
Guys, one slip-up on the next event,
and we're goners.
So for this to work,
I'm gonna need you to take
every instinct you have
and bury it deep, deep down.
Done.
From now on,
we are of one mind.
My mind.
Oh, please.
I will tell you exactly what to do,
and how to do it.
Uh... Okay, Mike.
Seems about right.
All right.
Give me scary steps.
Fifty up and down,
right now. Let's go!
You're wasting your time.
We need a new team.
We can't just "get a new team"!
I checked this morning.
It's against the rules.
What if we disguised a new team
to look like the old team?
Oh, no, no.
We are not cheating.
It's not cheating.
I'm just, you know,
leveling the playing field.
Okay, so it's kind of cheating,
but what do you want me to do?
They're not exactly the
scariest group in the world.
Oh, a ladybug!
Make a wish! Make a wish!
This is not going to work.
Where are you going?
We're training.
I'm a Sullivan.
That's not enough.
You're all over the place.
You're charging
ahead when you...
Bup, bup, bup!
You tell them what
to do but not me.
So long, Coach.
Okay, Oozmas...
Boy, we need to get you a bell.
Listen up. "If a kid hears you coming,
they'll call Mom or Dad,
"then you'd better run fast
or things will get bad."
Huh?
In the next event,
if even one of us gets caught,
we're all out.
So remember,
do exactly what I do.
We are at the
halfway point of the second event,
and things are
getting interesting.
Got it.
Only two teams left.
Who will make it
out with their flag,
and who will be eliminated?
In a real Scare,
you do not want to get
caught by a kid's parent.
And in this event,
you do not want to get caught by
the librarian.
Quiet.
What's so scary about a
little old librarian?
I said, "Quiet."
Faster.
Slow and steady.
Slow and steady.
Slow and steady.
Slow and steady.
Sullivan!
Sullivan!
Hmm.
Whew!
Ooh!
No!
Five, six, seven, eight!
Look over here!
Is that legal?
You better believe it, mop top!
The only rule is
don't get caught.
Whoo!
- Ooh!
- Hey! Over here!
Come and get me!
Come and get me! Whoo-hoo!
Guys, what are you doing?
They said don't
let her catch you.
But they didn't say how!
Move it! Move it!
Move it! Come on!
Whoa!
Whew!
We did it!
No, we didn't.
We forgot the flag!
Mike?
Way to go, Squishy!
Way to go, Squishy!
How?
Misdirection.
The EEKs have been eliminated
and Oozma Kappa live
to scare another day!
We're OK!
We're OK! We're OK!
I've never felt so alive!
We were awesome!
Okay, look.
That wasn't real Scaring.
It was better
than what you did.
You should've
stuck to my strategy.
Whatever.
Talk to me when we start
the real Scaring.
Hey! You guys
going to the party?
Oh, I think you've
got the wrong guys.
- We don't get invited to...
- Party?
The mid-games mixer
at the RORs'.
It's for the top Scare Teams.
You're one of us now, right?
See you there!
Did you hear that?
I can't believe it!
Uh-uh. Bad idea.
This is great.
They're finally seeing us as real Scarers.
We're going!
Do young people still dance?
Because my moves
are a little rusty.
Oh, we forgot to
bring a hostess gift.
We can't go in there without
some scented candles.
Calm down.
We earned this.
What if there's a lull
in the conversation?
I never know what
to... You know...
Say?
How are you so good at this?
You just took on
an angry 50-foot librarian,
and you're afraid
of a little party?
Take a deep breath...
and in you go!
Hello.
It's Oozma Kappa!
These guys are crazy!
What you did today was insane!
That was awesome!
Oozma Kappa,
tonight we party like Scarers!
I've never stayed up
this late in my life!
Hey, quiet! Quiet!
Quiet down,
you can-wranglers.
All right.
On behalf of the RORs,
we'd like to congratulate all the
teams that have made it this far.
All, right,
let's hear it for the PNKs!
I love that trick!
Never gets old. HSS!
Very creepy.
And finally,
the surprise team of the Scare Games,
Oozma Kappa!
Come on over, guys.
Now, I got to admit, fellas,
I thought you were
a bunch of nobodies.
But, boy, was I wrong.
Let's hear it for Oozma Kappa!
Oozma Kappa!
Oh!
What?
The most adorable
monsters on campus.
Ooh! Oh!
Release the stuffed animals.
Faced!
- Don't worry.
- Nobody reads the school paper.
Yeah,
but I'm pretty sure they read the quad.
Whoo-hoo!
Thank you very much.
Okay. Would you like that
with two sleeves or four?
Thanks.
Tell your friends.
Hey! What do you
think you're doing?
Raising a little
money for charity.
Yeah? Well, stop it.
You want us to stop raising money
for charity? That's not cool.
This guy hates charity!
I want you to stop
making us look like fools.
Hey, you're making yourselves
look like fools.
Let's be honest, boys.
You're never going
to be real Scarers,
because real Scarers
look like us.
But, hey, if you really want
to work for a Scare company
they're always
hiring in the mailroom.
Guys, hold on!
Hey, hey, hey! Wait a second.
Don't listen to him.
We just need to keep trying.
No, you need to stop trying!
You can train monsters
like this all you want,
but you can't
change who they are.
Mike...
We appreciate everything you've done,
but he's right.
No matter how much we train,
we'll never look like them.
We're built
for other things.
Sorry, squirt!
Some monsters just aren't
cut out for the big leagues.
The big leagues.
Guys.
We're going on
a little field trip.
My tentacle fell asleep.
Thanks, Mom.
Have fun, kids!
I'll just be here
listening to my tunes.
Hey, uh, where are we?
The big leagues.
Holy roly-poly.
Wow.
Nice fence.
This is amazing, Mike.
We're not stopping here.
This is crazy.
We're going to get arrested!
Oh, wow.
Whoa...
Oh!
All Scare Floors now activ.
West coast coming online.
Scarers coming out.
Look at them.
They're going
into the human world,
and they don't
even look scared!
Wow.
Take a good look, fellas.
See what they
all have in common?
Uh... No, not really.
Exactly. There's no
one type of Scarer.
The best Scarers use their
differences to their advantage.
Wow.
Terri? Look.
Hey!
Look at that old feller
racking up the big numbers!
Don, that old fella is
Earl "The Terror" Thompson!
What? Where?
That's really him?
He held the Scare
Record for three years!
Oh! Third door from the end!
Carla "Killer Claws" Benitez!
Look! It's
"Screaming" Bob Gunderson!
I still have his rookie card.
Me, too!
Doesn't have the speed anymore,
but his
technique is flawless.
Technique is flawless.
You collected Scare Cards, huh?
Yep. 450 of them.
Impressive.
I have 6,000 still in mint condition,
but, you know,
450 is pretty good, too.
Hey, look at me!
I'm Earl "The Terror" Thompson!
Whoa!
Oh, that's great!
That's
a pretty good one, Squish.
I've been a real jerk.
So have I.
But it's not too late.
We could be a great team.
We just need to
start working together.
Hey!
What are you doing up there?
I can't go back to jail!
Come on!
They're right behind us!
Get back here!
Up there! Get them!
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Thanks, brother!
Don't mention it.
I'm fine, really!
It's just a little heart attack.
Aw... I want
a piece of that action!
Mom! Start the car!
What?
Start the car!
Stop the bar?
The car! Start the car!
Oh! Okay.
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!
Get in! Get in!
Mom, go!
Seatbelts.
Okay, go!
Does anyone want gum?
Just drive!
Okay. Here we go!
Oh, yeah!
Let's break in somewhere else!
Rise and shine!
Scary feet, scary feet...
The kid is in the bathroom!
Scary feet, scary feet...
Oh, he's back!
Wake up!
Thirty-seven! Thirty-eight!
Do I hear thirty-nine?
Come on!
Yes! Okay, Oozma Kappa,
you're looking good.
"To frighten a child
is the point of a Scare.
"If you frighten a teen,
then Scarer beware."
Okay, scare the little kid.
Avoid the teenager!
I'm on the phone!
No one understands me!
Whatever.
But, Daddy, I love him!
First place, Roar Omega Roar!
Second place, Oozma Kappa!
Whoo!
Third place, HSS.
You're lame.
"Someone is coming,
this could ruin your night.
"Stay hidden, take cover,
and stay out of sight!"
You got 10 seconds.
Go!
Kiosk! Pile of leaves!
Standing out in the open.
And there should be one more.
How did I do?
Oh! Not too
shabby, Don!
Thanks!
I cannot get down.
Zombie snarl!
Angry poodle.
Jazz clown.
My Aunt Phyllis.
In the morning.
That's what I'm talking about!
Time to go to work.
You're out!
You're out.
Hey, tough luck, Kris Kringle.
Thank you.
Yeah!
Yeah!
We're down to o remaining team,
Roar Omega Rr and Oozma Ka!
Which leads us to
the final event!
"Every one of your skills
will be put to the test.
"The Scare Simulator will
prove who's the best!"
Tomorrow night
you finally get to Scare
in front of the whole school!
Enjoy the attention
while it lasts, boys.
After you lose,
no one will remember you.
Maybe. But when you lose,
no one will let you forget it.
Oh, boy. That is
a good point.
Hey, Oozmas,
you guys are awesome!
You've got to
teach us your moves.
Well, then you're gonna
want to talk to this guy.
Oh...
Sure, I can teach you.
All right. You want to
hide behind the chair?
You have to become the chair.
Thanks for coming, Dean.
Dean Hardscrabble!
If we get back into
the Scaring program,
I hope there's
no hard feelings.
Tomorrow,
each of you must prove
that you are undeniably scary.
And I know for a fact
that one of you is not.
No. He works
harder than anyone.
Do you think he's scary?
He's the heart and
soul of the team!
Do you think he's scary?
We're going to win this thing tomorrow,
Sull, I can feel it!
We'll finally have
our lives back on track.
Hey, Mike?
You know, you've given me
a lot of really great tips.
I'd love to return
the favor sometime.
Oh. Yeah, sure.
Anytime.
We're doing this now?
Okay.
You've memorized
every textbook,
every Scare Theory,
and that is great.
Hey!
But now it's time
to forget all that.
Just reach deep down
and let the scary out!
Huh. Just feel it.
Exactly. Go wild.
I don't know. I've kind of
got my own technique.
Give it a try.
Good, but bigger!
Nope. You're thinking again.
From the gut!
Let the animal out!
Come on! Dig deep!
Boys!
It's a school night!
So, how was that?
Up top.
Ha-ha!
You know,
it did feel different!
I feel like it's
all coming together.
Yup, this time tomorrow the whole
school is finally going to see
what Mike Wazowski can do.
You're darn right.
# Monsters University
# We give our heart to yu
# Wherever
children are dreaming
# We'll bring them
nightmares, too
# Oh, Monsters University
# Alma Mater hail to you
Welcome to the final competition
of the Scare Gam.
Whoo! Yeah!
All right!
It's time to see how terrifying
you really are,
in the Scare Simulators!
But be warne.
Each simulated Se has been set
to the highest difficulty lev.
The highest level?
First Scarers to the starting line.
Okay, just like we planned.
I'll go first. Then, Don...
Hold on. Mike's the one
who started all this
and I think it's only right if
he's the one who finishes it.
I think you should go last.
Yes!
Yeah, Mike. Finish strong!
All right. Don,
you okay going first?
I guess I'm as ready
as I'll ever be.
Oozma Kappa!
Go Oozmas!
I'm gonna do it.
I'm going to beat this guy.
Hey, Bruiser!
You take it easy on grandpa.
Unleash the beast, Don!
Okay, then.
Huh? Huh?
Thanks for taking
it easy on grandpa.
Next group to the starting line.
Let's do this.
Yes! Yeah!
Come on, Art.
Come on, buddy.
You can do it.
Yes!
Aw!
Next up, Sullivan and Boggs!
You got this, Sull.
And it's all tied up!
Ah!
Tough break for the RORs.
Huh?
Hearts?
Huh?
Way to go, Boggs!
Yay!
That's the last time
I lose to you, Sullivan.
Worthington and Wazowski,
to the starting line.
Hey.
Don't worry about Hardscrabble.
Don't worry about anyone else.
Just go out there and show them
what Mike Wazowski can do.
Thanks.
Don't take the loss too hard.
You never belonged here anyway.
Amazing
performance by Worthington!
- Johnny, you're my hero!
- ROR! ROR!
The Oozmas
will need a record-breakg
Scare to win this.
You don't belong on a Scare Floor.
No one will remember yo.
You're not scary.
Come on! Dig deep!
Yeah!
They did it!
Yeah! Hey!
We're in the Scare
program! Yeah!
Come here, you son of a gun!
Way to go!
Yeah!
Oh! A little stuck.
Pardon me there,
Ms. Squibbles.
It's Sherrie.
We did it!
Way to go, Oozma Kappa!
Thank you!
Thanks a lot.
You rule!
I have never ruled before.
You guys killed it out there!
Awesome!
Hey, Wazowski!
Come on, let's go, you maniac!
We're celebrating.
Mike?
I did it.
I can't believe it.
I'm going to be a Scarer!
Yeah, yes, you are.
You hear that?
Get plenty of rest, kiddo.
You haven't seen the last
of Mike Wazowski. Boo!
I knew I was scary.
I didn't know I was that scary.
Yeah,
we're so scary I guess we broke it.
Come on.
It's been tampered with.
Uh, I don't think you should
be messing with that.
Why are my settings different?
Mike, we should leave.
Did you do this?
Mike.
Did you do this?
I...
Yes, I did.
But you don't understand.
Why? Why did you do this?
You know, just in case.
In case of what?
You don't think I'm scary.
Mike...
You said you believed in me.
But you're just
like Hardscrabble.
You're just like everyone else!
Look, you'll get
better and better...
I'm as scary as you!
I'm as scary as anyone!
I just wanted to help.
No.
You just wanted
to help yourself.
Well, what was
I supposed to do?
Let the whole team fail
because you don't have it?
So your calculations were a little off.
That door took me all semester.
It's too dangerous.
The professor's just going to shred it.
There he is, the big guy.
The first of many
trophies, I am sure.
Sullivan.
Nice work out there.
I look forward to
having you back in class.
Hey, there he is!
Looks like I was
wrong about you.
You're one of us after all.
Way to go, Sulley!
Welcome back, broham!
You are one of us now, okay?
Anytime you want
to come hang out
and do whatever,
you got a crew.
You're a ROR, buddy!
Hey!
Where are you going?
You did what?
My team had
nothing to do with it.
It was all me. I cheated.
I expect you off
campus by tomorrow.
Yes, ma'am.
You're a disgrace
to this university
and your family name.
What's going on?
Someone broke
into the door lab!
What?
Oh, no.
Open the door!
Don't go in there!
You look funny.
What?
I'm so tired.
What's going on?
It's the middle of the night.
A little funny green guy.
I want to touch it!
It's so cute!
James!
No one goes near that door
until the authorities arrive.
You don't think
that could be...
It's Mike.
But he could die out there!
James, wait!
We can help.
Leave it to
the old master of sales.
We got a call in,
but that's the best we can do.
Ahem!
Don Carlton, sales.
Folks, today is your lucky day.
How many times have you asked
yourself the following question...
Arrest him.
Pardon?
Spread them, pops!
Do you mind?
Don't move!
What? Sullivan!
Don't you dare!
Sullivan! Don't go in there!
Mike?
Mike!
The kids said they
saw something in the cabin.
They're calling it an alien.
It was!
I saw a little green guy!
What's the problem, ma'am?
Mike?
Bear! A bear in the camp!
Call this in to headquarters.
Down this way.
All right?
I heard something over here!
Mike!
Come on, buddy.
Let's get you out of here.
This is all my fault.
I'm sorry.
You were right.
They weren't scared of me.
I did everything right.
I wanted it more than anyone.
And I thought...
I thought if I wanted it enough,
I could show everybody that...
That Mike Wazowski
is something special.
And I'm just
not.
Look, Mike,
I know how you feel.
Don't do that!
Please, don't do that!
You do not know how I feel.
Mike, calm down.
Monsters like you have everything.
You don't have to be good.
You can mess up
over and over again
and the whole world loves you.
Mike...
You'll never know
what it's like to fail
because you were
born a Sullivan!
Yeah, I'm a Sullivan.
I'm the Sullivan
who flunked every test.
The one who got kicked out
of the program,
the one who was so afraid
to let everyone down
that I cheated.
And I lied.
Mike, I'll never know
how you feel,
but you're not
the only failure here.
I act scary, Mike,
but most of the time
I'm terrified.
How come you never
told me that before?
Because
we weren't friends before.
Check the lake!
I heard something here!
This way!
I saw movement!
Over there!
Sulley!
He's cornered!
No!
They're still in there!
Until the authorities arrive,
this door stays off!
No! You can't
do that! No!
Enough! I want
this room cleared now!
You can't do this!
We got to get out of here!
Let them come.
What?
If we scare them,
I mean really scare them,
we could generate enough scream
to power the door
from this side!
What are you talking about?
I have read every book
about Scaring ever written.
This could work!
They're adults.
I can't do this.
Yes, you can.
Just follow my lead.
Mama!
Mama!
Mama...
What the...
Now what?
Phase two.
Keep together.
Are you ready?
Mike, I can't.
Yes, you can.
Stop being a Sullivan
and start being you.
Call for backup.
Assistance on the north side.
Repeat, we need assistance
on the north side.
Ranger,
answer me, what's your 20?
We need assistance on the north side.
We have a...
Look! What was it?
Let's go.
Sulley, come on!
How?
How did you do this?
Don't ask me.
Move, move, move!
This is a 54-23 in progress.
All right,
everybody, clear out.
Secure the perimeter.
No child breach.
Repeat: No child breach.
You ruined our doors!
I've been working on
my door all semester!
Let's go, you two.
You're alive!
We are so glad you're safe.
Hey, wait!
What's going to happen to them?
That's for the
university president to decide.
But you can be sure we'll
be watching these two.
Always watching.
Expelled?
Yeah, we really messed up.
So, you're leaving?
Yeah, buddy. We have to go.
Harsh, man.
I'm sorry, guys.
You'd be in the Scaring program
right now if it wasn't for us.
What?
Well, it is
the gosh-darnedest thing.
Hardscrabble's letting us
into the Scare program.
What?
She was impressed with our
performance in the games.
She invited us to
join next semester!
Congratulations, guys!
And that's not the
only piece of good news.
Sherrie and I are engaged!
Oh. Who is Sherrie?
She's my mom.
Well, if it isn't my
two favorite fellas!
Come here.
Give me some sugar.
Oh!
Ugh! So uncomfortable.
Oh, come on, Scott.
I don't want you to think
of me as your new dad.
After all,
we're fraternity brothers first.
This is so weird.
Just think of me
as your big brother
that's marrying your mother.
Wait. Hold on.
We're brothers who share
the same mom slash wife.
That's worse.
Well, I guess
we should be going now.
Promise me
you'll keep in touch.
You're the scariest bunch
of monsters I have ever met.
Don't let anyone
tell you different.
So, what now?
You know, for the first time in my life,
I don't really have a plan.
You're the great Mike Wazowski.
You'll come up with something.
I think it's time I leave the
greatness to other monsters.
I'm okay just being okay.
So long, Sull.
So long.
Wazowski!
Whoa!
Stop the bus!
Are you crazy?
Mike,
I don't know a single Scarer
who can do what you do.
I know,
everyone sees us together,
they think I'm the one running the show,
but the truth is,
I've been riding your
coattails since day one!
You made the deal
with Hardscrabble.
You took a hopeless team
and made them champions.
All I did was catch a pig!
Technically, I caught the pig.
Exactly! And you
think you're just okay?
You pulled off the biggest Scare
this school has ever seen!
That wasn't me!
That was you!
You think I could have
done that without you?
I didn't even bring a pencil
on the first day of school.
Mike, you're not scary.
Not even a little.
But you are fearless.
And if Hardscrabble can't see that,
then she can just...
I can just what?
Careful, Mr. Sullivan.
I was just warming up to you.
Sorry.
Well, gentlemen,
it seems you made
the front page again.
The two of you did
something together
that no one has
ever done before.
You surprised me.
Perhaps I should keep an
eye out for more surprises
like you in my program.
But as far as the two
of you are concerned
there is nothing
I can do for you now.
Except, perhaps, wish you luck.
And, Mr. Wazowski,
keep surprising people.
You know,
there is still one way
we can work at a Scare company.
They're always
hiring in the mailroom.
This is better
than I ever imagined!
I bet we break the all-time
record in our first year.
Mike, we're mail guys.
I know. I'm talking about the
record for letters delivered!
All right, newbies,
quit goofing around.
I'll have you know tampering
with the mail is a crime
punishable by banishment!
Yes, sir.
We're right on it,
Mr. Snowman.
The team of
Wazowski and Sullivan
are going to change
the world starting today!
Say scream!
Scream!
Scream!
Wazowski,
good luck on your first day!
Thanks, Merv.
Good luck, Mike!
Thanks, fellas.
You coming, Coach?
You better believe it.
I made it!
My first day of class!
Uh, the school year's over, son.
You missed it.
Great.
