Following the 9/11 terror attacks, Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-SD) walked into the Oval Office and told President Bush his call for a full-scale war on terrorism had fallen on deaf ears. The president was "lost" on the subject, Daschle said in the Oval Office.
Bush called the president at home on August 30, 2001. "It wasn't and isn't," he said, according to someone who was present at the time. "It may have been a minute or two and a half," he continued.
"Will you say it again?"
"We can't win this war. It's a lost cause, John."
"I can't back up what I'm telling you, sir," Bush said. "We can't win this war."
"Yeah, I know I can't."
" I hope I can help you out, sir," Bush said.
" Well, you don't know, do you?
I want you to keep talking about this.
…I need to put a scare in you,
Jim.
I need you to keep talking about this.
I need you to keep talking about this.
I need you to make the President hopeful
We're going to get it right, John.
We can't lose this war.
We need to win this war.
That is what I will do,
I will win this war.
We have to win this war.
That's right.
We have to win this war.
Now, I'm more worried about you,
Jim.
You know, you're right, sir.
I think this will be a bust.
We'll get it all
back together,
and I'll be happy
with America's place
in the world again.
" I miss the old days.
" Now, I'm very hopeful.
Right now, we're on the verge of something
that's going to make us
recover.
There's a great deal.
Give me five seconds of your time.
I need to get out of here.
– I have to get out of here, Jim!
You can't just stay here!
Don't stay here, Jim!
You've been put in this hard environment.
This will be your only chance to start over.
You're going to start over.
– Get out of here!
I'm going
of my own free will.
– Get out of here, Jim!
– Get out of here!
I can't predict what will happen.
We can't predict what will happen.
You'll have to watch me.
I look like a puddle pig.
I look like a puddle pig.
It used to be, Jim.
– Oh, yeah?
- Come on, stop it. Get in
